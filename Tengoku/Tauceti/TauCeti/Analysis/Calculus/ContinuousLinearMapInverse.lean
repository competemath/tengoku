# Inverting and differentiating continuous linear maps

This file collects two kinds of facts about inverting continuous linear maps. The first is a
perturbation criterion: a map differing from a continuous linear equivalence `L` by less than
`‖L⁻¹‖⁻¹` in operator norm is again invertible, by a Neumann series. The second packages the
derivative of a differentiable inverse family of continuous linear maps at an invertible base
point, including its action on a varying vector; that is the analytic input for differentiating a
vector-field pullback along a parametric family.

## Main results

* `ContinuousLinearMap.isInvertible_of_norm_sub_lt` and
  `ContinuousLinearMap.isInvertible_of_norm_sub_le_half`: a continuous linear map closer to an
  invertible one than the reciprocal norm of its inverse — or than half of it — is itself
  invertible.
* `HasDerivAt.clm_inverse`: differentiates `(A t)⁻¹`.
* `HasDerivAt.clm_inverse_apply`: differentiates `(A t)⁻¹ (w t)`.
* `DifferentiableAt.clm_inverse_of_completeSpace`: the inverse of a differentiable family between
  Banach spaces is differentiable at an invertible base point.
* `HasDerivAt.clm_inverse_of_completeSpace`: the Banach-space specialization for an inverse family.
* `HasDerivAt.clm_inverse_apply_of_completeSpace`: the Banach-space specialization acting on a
  vector curve.
