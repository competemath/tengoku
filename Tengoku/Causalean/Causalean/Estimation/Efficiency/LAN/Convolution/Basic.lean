# Local experiments and local asymptotic normality

This module gives a paper-independent interface for triangular local experiments.  A local
experiment consists of a base law and one local-alternative law for each finite-dimensional
direction.  Its log likelihood ratio is the logarithm of the Radon--Nikodym derivative of the
absolutely continuous part of the local law with respect to the base law.

Weak convergence is formulated by bounded continuous test functions so that the sample space
may vary with the row.  `IsLAN` records the Gaussian central-sequence limit and the quadratic
log-likelihood expansion.  No survival-analysis or paper-run objects occur in this layer.

/-- A row-indexed random element converges weakly to `Q` when its expectation against every
bounded continuous real test function converges to the corresponding expectation under `Q`.

The definition permits a different measurable sample space and probability law in every row.
Probability and measurability assumptions are carried by the surrounding experiment and the
theorems using this predicate. -/

logarithm of the real Radon--Nikodym derivative of the local law's absolutely continuous part.
Where that derivative is zero, the extended-real value `-∞` is represented by the diverging
finite truncation `-n`; DQM makes this exceptional event asymptotically negligible. -/

embeds parameter directions into an ambient `L²`-type Hilbert space `K`; `gradient` belongs to
the score range, the information is the score inner product, and target derivatives are inner
products with the gradient.  Consequently its efficient variance is `‖gradient‖²`. -/
