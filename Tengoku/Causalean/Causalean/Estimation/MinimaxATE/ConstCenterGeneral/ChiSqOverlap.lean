# Structure-agnostic ATE lower bound: χ²-overlap (general constant center)

The general-constant-center analogue of `ChiSqOverlap.lean`.  It records the closed form
of the single-observation χ²-overlap of two perturbed laws (indexed by sign vectors
`λ, λ'`) relative to the null, around a constant center `(m₀, g₀, g₁)`:

  `chiSqOverlapG λ λ' = 1 + (Γ/K) · Σⱼ signOf(λ j) signOf(λ' j)`,

where the per-cell overlap coefficient is

  `Γ = m₀·α²/g₁ + m₀·(α + β/g₁)²/(1 − g₁) + m₀²·β²/(g₁²·(1 − m₀))`.

At `m₀ = g₁ = 1/2` this collapses to `Γ = 2(α² + 2αβ + 3β²)`, matching the `2γ`
coefficient of `ChiSqOverlap.lean`.  The linear-in-`Δ` terms cancel by construction, and
summing over the two positions of a pair leaves only the `λ·λ'` cross term — exactly
the structure the abstract `ingster_bound` consumes (instantiated with `γ = Γ/2`).

/-! # General-Center Chi-Squared Second-Moment Overlap

This file derives the closed-form single-observation chi-squared overlap for two
general constant-center Rademacher perturbations relative to the null law.  The formula isolates
the per-cell overlap coefficient that feeds the Ingster second-moment argument,
with the linear perturbation terms canceling by construction.  "Overlap" here is
the χ² second-moment overlap of two likelihood ratios, not the causal
positivity/overlap condition.

The definition `Γ` is the per-cell coefficient, `chiSqOverlapG` is the raw
single-observation overlap, `obsReal_pertG_eq` gives the denominator-free
observed-mass formula for the four treatment/outcome cells, and
`chiSqOverlap_eqG` proves the closed form
`1 + (Γ / K) * ∑ j, signOf (lam j) * signOf (lam' j)`. -/
