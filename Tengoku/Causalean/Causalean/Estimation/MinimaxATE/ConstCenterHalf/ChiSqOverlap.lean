# Structure-agnostic ATE lower bound: single-observation mass and χ²-overlap

This file records a full-support measure lemma and two exact finite computations
for the construction of `Construction.lean`:

* `absolutelyContinuous_of_singleton_pos` — any measure is absolutely continuous
  with respect to a measure that charges every singleton;
* `obsLaw_real_singleton` — the single-observation law assigns to each point
  `z` exactly the real mass `obsReal m g z`;
* `chiSqOverlap_eq` — the closed form of the single-observation χ²-overlap of two
  perturbed laws (indexed by sign vectors `λ, λ'`) relative to the null:

    `chiSqOverlap α β λ λ' = 1 + (2 (α² + 2αβ + 3β²) / K) Σ_j signOf(λ j) signOf(λ' j)`.

/-! # Base Chi-Squared Second-Moment Overlap

This file supplies the common full-support absolute-continuity lemma and computes the singleton
probabilities and single-observation chi-squared overlap for the base paired-cell perturbation
family. The helper `obsLaw_real_singleton` identifies the real mass of a singleton observation,
`chiSqOverlap` defines the one-observation second-moment overlap, and `obsReal_perturbed_eq` gives
a denominator-free formula for each perturbed observed-data mass.

The main theorem `chiSqOverlap_eq` proves the closed form used by the Ingster
indistinguishability argument. "Overlap" here means the χ² second-moment overlap between two
perturbed observed-data laws relative to the null; it is not the causal positivity/overlap
assumption.
