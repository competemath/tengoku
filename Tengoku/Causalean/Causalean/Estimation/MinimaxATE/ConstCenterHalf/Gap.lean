# Structure-agnostic ATE lower bound: the exact ATE gap of the construction

The explicit Case-1 construction of `Construction.lean` perturbs the treated
arm by `gλ(1,·) = (1/2 + α·Δ)/(1 − 2β·Δ)`, leaving the control arm and the null
estimate `ĝ ≡ 1/2` untouched.  The key fact behind the lower bound is that the
**average treatment effect of the construction is exactly**

  `ate gλ = 2β(α+β)/(1 − 4β²)`,

**independent of the Rademacher sign vector `λ`**.  This is the bias that any
estimator faces against the indistinguishable family: within each pair `j` the
two positions contribute `(1/2 + α s)/(1 − 2β s) − 1/2` and
`(1/2 − α s)/(1 + 2β s) − 1/2` with `s = signOf (λ j) ∈ {±1}`, and these two
asymmetric contributions sum to `4β(α+β)/(1 − 4β²)` regardless of `s`.  The null
estimate `ĝ ≡ 1/2` has zero ATE, so the gap equals the same quantity.

/-! # Base ATE Gap

This file computes the exact average treatment effect gap for the base paired-cell
perturbation family. The theorem `ate_ghat` records that the centered null estimate has zero
ATE. The private calculation `perPair` collapses the two positions in a paired cell, and
`ate_gPerturbed` sums those contributions to show that every sign-indexed perturbation has the
same ATE `2β(α+β)/(1−4β²)`.

The public theorem `ate_gap` packages the separation between the perturbed construction and the
null estimate; this is the ATE separation used in the finite two-point lower bound.

Summing the per-pair contributions (`perPair`, each `4β(α+β)/(1−4β²)`, independent of the signs
`λ`) over the `K` pairs and dividing by `card (Fin K × Bool) = 2K` gives the closed form.
