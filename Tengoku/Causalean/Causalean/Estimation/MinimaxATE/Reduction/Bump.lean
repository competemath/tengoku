# Structure-agnostic ATE estimation: `l2sq` algebra and Rademacher bumps

Small reusable algebra lemmas about the squared `L²(P_X)` distance `l2sq` and
constant-magnitude (Rademacher) bumps.  These are used to verify class-membership
(`InClass`) in the structure-agnostic lower-bound construction: a perturbation of a
nuisance by `δ` times a sign function `σ` (with `(σ x)² = 1`) moves the `L²` distance
by exactly `δ²`, which lands a Rademacher bump on the boundary of the budget class.

/-! # Squared-Distance Bump Algebra

This file provides finite squared-distance identities for functions on a covariate
space.  It proves the basic algebraic facts `l2sq_self`, `l2sq_comm`, and `l2sq_nonneg`, then
records the Rademacher-bump identity `l2sq_bump`: if `a x = b x + δ * σ x` and every sign satisfies
`(σ x)^2 = 1`, then the squared distance from `a` to `b` is exactly `δ^2` on a nonempty finite
space.  This is the reusable membership calculation for lower-bound perturbations that are placed
on the boundary of an `InClass` budget. -/

/-- **Constant-magnitude (Rademacher) bump.** If [a sign function σ satisfies `(σ x)² = 1` at
every covariate value](hyp:hσ), then on a nonempty finite covariate space, [the squared
`L²(P_X)` distance between `b` shifted by `δ·σ` and `b` itself equals `δ²`](goal). This is
exactly what makes a Rademacher-bump perturbation land on the boundary of the nuisance class
`ℱ(ε,·)` when `δ = √ε`. -/
