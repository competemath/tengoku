# Structure-agnostic ATE estimation: the finite observed-data model

This is the finite observed-data layer for the structure-agnostic optimality lower bound of
doubly-robust ATE estimation (Jin–Syrgkanis 2024, *Structure-agnostic
Optimality of Doubly Robust Learning for Treatment Effect Estimation*).

The paper works on `X ∈ [0,1]^K` with `X` uniform, partitions the cube into
`M = 2^m` cells, and makes every nuisance **piecewise-constant on those cells**.
The within-cell continuum carries no information for the construction, so we
collapse each cell to a point and work with a **finite covariate** `X : C` for an
arbitrary finite type `C` (uniform mass `1/card C`), binary treatment `D : Bool`,
and binary outcome `Y : Bool`.  One observation is the finite type

  `Obs C := C × Bool × Bool`,

so every data law is a PMF on a finite type and the total-variation / χ² /
ATE quantities are all finite sums.  This is exactly the paper's cell structure,
stated directly.  (Keeping `C` general — rather than `Fin M` — lets the explicit
lower-bound construction take `C = Fin K × Bool`, the pair-index × position
structure that its sign perturbation needs; see `Construction.lean`.)

A DGP is a pair `(m, g)` with propensity `m : C → ℝ` (the conditional
`P(D = 1 | X = x)`) and outcome regression `g : Bool → C → ℝ`
(`g d x = E[Y | D = d, X = x]`).  Under conditional ignorability the ATE is

  `ate g = (1/card C) Σ_x (g true x − g false x)`.

Main definitions:

* `ValidDGP m g` — the nuisances take values in `[0,1]`;
* `obsLaw m g hv` — the single-observation law as a probability `Measure (Obs C)`;
* `ate g`, `l2sq a b` — the ATE functional and the (squared) `L²(P_X)` distance;
* `InClass mhat ghat εg εm m g` — membership in the structure-agnostic nuisance
  class `ℱ` around fixed estimates `(mhat, ghat)` with squared error budgets
  `εg` (outcome arms) and `εm` (propensity);
* `productLaw m g hv n`, `minimaxMiss …` — the `n`-sample data law and the
  worst-case-over-class probability that an estimator misses the true ATE by `s`.

/-! # Finite observed-data model for ATE estimation

This file supplies the finite observed-data experiment used for structure-agnostic estimation of
the average treatment effect: a finite covariate, binary treatment, and binary outcome. It defines
the data laws, nuisance class, sample risks, and minimax miss probability used by the lower-bound
construction. -/
