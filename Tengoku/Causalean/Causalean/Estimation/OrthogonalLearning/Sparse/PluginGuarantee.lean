# Deterministic sparse plug-in ERM guarantee

Headline finite-dimensional sparse plug-in theorem: under restricted strong
convexity at the truth, convex empirical risk, the support hypothesis
`|S₀| = s`, the first-order condition `∇L(θ₀, g₀) = 0`, and a penalty level
dominating twice the ℓ∞ deviation of the empirical gradient, every sparse
plug-in regularised ERM `θhat` satisfies

* `θhat - θ₀ ∈ RestrictedCone S₀`,
* `‖θhat - θ₀‖₂ ≤ 12 · lambda · √s / σn`.

/-! # Sparse Plug-In Guarantee

This file proves the deterministic sparse plug-in guarantee for penalized
empirical risk minimization under restricted strong convexity, support
sparsity, a first-order condition at the target, and a gradient-deviation
bound. It also states the high-probability interface that will turn a tail
bound for the gradient deviation into the same sparse estimation guarantee.

The deterministic theorem `sparse_plugin_guarantee` proves membership of
`θhat - θ₀` in `RestrictedCone S₀` and the displayed `12 * lambda * sqrt s / σn`
error bound. The predicate `LinftyDevTailBound` and theorem
`sparse_plugin_guarantee_highProb` lift this deterministic guarantee to a
high-probability event. -/

/-- **Deterministic sparse plug-in ERM guarantee.** Let empRiskFn be a convex empirical
risk function on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin p)`, with population gradient popGrad and
empirical gradient map gradEmp. Assume [the support S₀ of the truth θ₀ has cardinality
s](hyp:hs), that [θ₀ vanishes off S₀](hyp:h_supp), that [the restricted-strong-convexity
modulus σn is strictly positive](hyp:hσn) and [empRiskFn is σn-restricted-strongly-convex
at θ₀ over S₀](hyp:h_RSC), and that [the empirical gradient at θ₀ satisfies the
subgradient basic inequality for empRiskFn](hyp:h_subgrad). Given a penalty level with
[`lambda > 0`](hyp:h_lambda_pos), suppose [the index set `Fin p` is nonempty](hyp:hp) so
that [lambda is at least twice the sup-norm deviation of the empirical gradient from the
population gradient at θ₀](hyp:h_lambda_lb), that [the population gradient vanishes at
the truth (the first-order condition)](hyp:h_FOC_pop), and that [θhat is a sparse plug-in
regularised empirical-risk minimizer at penalty level lambda](hyp:h_pluginERM). Then [the
estimation error `θhat − θ₀` lies in the restricted cone around S₀, and its Euclidean norm
is at most `12 · lambda · √s / σn`](goal).

* `empRiskFn`     — empirical risk with the plug-in nuisance absorbed.
* `popGrad`       — population gradient at the truth, `∇L(θ₀, g₀)`.
* `gradEmp`       — empirical gradient as a function of the parameter.
* `θ₀`, `θhat`    — truth and estimator.
* `S₀`, `s`       — support of `θ₀` and its cardinality.
* `h_supp`        — `θ₀` is supported on `S₀`.
* `h_conv`        — `empRiskFn` is convex on the ambient space.
* `σn`, `h_RSC`   — `σn`-RSC of `empRiskFn` at `θ₀` over `S₀`.
* `h_subgrad`     — subgradient inequality at `θ₀`; this is the basic
                    inequality input that would follow from threading
                    `gradEmp θ₀ ∈ ∂empRiskFn(θ₀)` explicitly.
* `lambda`        — penalty level.
* `h_lambda_lb`   — `lambda ≥ 2 · ‖∇emp θ₀ - popGrad‖_∞` (using `linftyDev`
                   on the nonempty index set of `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin p)`).
* `h_FOC_pop`     — first-order condition at the truth, `popGrad = 0`.
* `h_pluginERM`   — `θhat` is a sparse plug-in regularised ERM.

Conclusion: `θhat - θ₀ ∈ RestrictedCone S₀` and the ℓ² bound.

/-! ## High-probability sparse plug-in guarantee

The deterministic theorem `sparse_plugin_guarantee` consumes the
penalty-domination hypothesis
`lambda ≥ 2 · linftyDev hp (gradEmp θ₀ − popGrad)` as a deterministic
inequality.  In practice that hypothesis is met only on a high-probability
event under fold-B concentration of the empirical gradient.

`LinftyDevTailBound` is the high-probability event predicate.  A concrete
gradient-deviation concentration theorem (a sibling discharge to
`OrthogonalLearning.LocalEmpProcess.Rademacher`'s `LocalEmpProcessModulus`) is
left to a follow-up; here we expose the wrapper that lifts the deterministic
guarantee to the high-probability statement once such a tail bound is supplied.
-/

/-- Given [a measure on a sample space](hyp:μ), [a nonempty finite coordinate set](hyp:hp), [a
sample-indexed vector-valued deviation field](hyp:dev), [a deviation threshold](hyp:ρ), and [a
confidence tolerance](hyp:δ), the [high-probability sup-norm tail-bound condition](goal) holds
exactly when there exists an event that is [measurable](step:1), has measure at least
$1-\delta^+$, with subtraction truncated at zero, and on which the maximum absolute coordinate of the deviation field is at
most the threshold.

This is the gradient-deviation analogue of
`Causalean.Estimation.OrthogonalLearning.LocalEmpProcessModulus`. Concrete
McDiarmid, sub-Gaussian, or fold-B concentration assumptions can discharge this
tail bound; here it is a hypothesis. -/

/-- **High-probability sparse plug-in ERM guarantee.** Let empRiskFn(ω) be a random
empirical risk function on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin p)` with random empirical gradient map
gradEmp(ω). Assume [the support S₀ of the truth θ₀
has cardinality s](hyp:hs), that [θ₀ vanishes off S₀](hyp:h_supp), and that [empRiskFn(ω)
is convex on the ambient space for every ω](hyp:h_conv). Suppose [the restricted-strong-
convexity modulus σn is strictly positive](hyp:hσn), and that [the
empirical gradient at θ₀ satisfies the subgradient basic inequality for empRiskFn(ω), for
every ω](hyp:h_subgrad). Given a penalty level with [`lambda > 0`](hyp:h_lambda_pos), and
assuming [the index set `Fin p` is nonempty](hyp:hp), and that [θhat(ω) is a sparse plug-in regularised
empirical-risk minimizer of empRiskFn(ω) at penalty level lambda, for every
ω](hyp:h_pluginERM). Suppose further that [on one measurable event of probability at least
`1-δ`, restricted strong convexity holds and the empirical-gradient deviation is at most
ρ](hyp:hGoodEvent), with
[lambda at least twice that tail level, `lambda ≥ 2ρ`](hyp:h_lambda_dom). Then [there is
an event of probability at least `1 - δ` on which, for every ω in it, the estimation
error `θhat ω − θ₀` lies in the restricted cone around S₀ and its Euclidean norm is at
most `12 · lambda · √s / σn`](goal).

Lift `sparse_plugin_guarantee` to a *probability-1−δ* statement once the
empirical gradient `gradEmp ω θ₀` satisfies an ℓ∞ tail bound `≤ ρ`
with `lambda ≥ 2 ρ` (the deterministic version's hypothesis is then
automatically met on the tail event).

The conclusion is: with `μ`-probability at least `1 − δ`,

* `θhat ω − θ₀ ∈ RestrictedCone S₀`,
* `‖θhat ω − θ₀‖ ≤ 12 · lambda · √s / σn`.
