# Local empirical-process modulus for an `LearningSystem`

`LocalEmpProcessModulus S S_iid split ρ δ g` packages the local
empirical-process modulus condition from
`def:est-osl-local-modulus`: with probability at least `1 - δ` (under the
ambient sample measure `μ`), the centred excess risk is bounded by
`ρ_n · ‖θ - θ₀‖ + ρ_n²` uniformly over `Θ_set`, for the realised
nuisance `g`.

This file only defines the predicate. Separate modulus modules discharge it
from empirical-process inputs such as bounded-loss Rademacher bounds and
localized critical-radius bounds, so downstream oracle inequalities can either
assume this condition directly or import a concrete bridge theorem.

See `doc/basic_concepts/po/estimation/orthogonal_statistical_learning.tex`,
`def:est-osl-local-modulus`.

/-! # Local Empirical-Process Modulus

This file states the local empirical-process modulus assumption used in
orthogonal statistical learning: with high probability, empirical excess risk
is uniformly close to population excess risk at a rate depending on the
distance to the population target. The predicate serves as the bridge from
empirical-process theory to oracle inequalities for plug-in estimators. -/

/-- Given [an orthogonal statistical-learning system](hyp:S), [an independent and identically
distributed sample with the system's population law](hyp:S_iid), [a one-shot sample split](hyp:split),
[a rate sequence](hyp:ρ), [a confidence tolerance](hyp:δ), and [a nuisance function](hyp:g), the
[local empirical-process modulus condition](goal) holds exactly when, for every sample size, there
exists an event that is [measurable](step:1), has measure at least $1-\delta^+$, with subtraction
truncated at zero, and on
which, uniformly over the target class, the population excess risk minus the fold-B empirical
excess risk is at most $\rho_n$ times the distance from the distinguished target plus
$\rho_n^2$.

For each sample size `n`, there is an event `E n ⊆ Ω` of probability at
least `1 - δ` such that, on `E n`, the centred excess risk satisfies
the modulus inequality uniformly over `Θ_set`:

```
∀ θ ∈ Θ_set,
    [L θ g  -  L θ₀ g]   -   [L_emp θ g  -  L_emp θ₀ g]
        ≤  ρ n · ‖θ - θ₀‖ + (ρ n)^2
```

where `L_emp θ g := empRiskFoldB n ω θ g`.

This is a `Prop`-valued *named condition*, not a standing assumption of the
library.  Oracle inequalities (`OracleInequality.lean`) consume it, while the
`Rademacher` and `Localized` bridge theorems in this directory **discharge** it
from empirical-process inputs (bounded-loss Rademacher bounds, localized
critical-radius bounds).  The whole quantifier structure (event,
deterministic-`ρ`-and-`δ`, uniform-in-`θ`) is packaged as a single predicate so
those theorems can pass it around as one object; the event `E n` is
existentially quantified per `n` (a single deterministic event schedule). -/
