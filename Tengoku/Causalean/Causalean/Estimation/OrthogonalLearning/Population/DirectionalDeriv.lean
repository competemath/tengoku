# Directional-derivative bundles for a `LearningSystem`

Mirrors `Estimation.OrthogonalMoments.HasDirDeriv`, but for the loss `ℓ : Z → Θ → G → ℝ`
of an orthogonal statistical-learning system rather than a moment functional.
We carry three bundles:

* `HasDirDerivTheta S g`   — pointwise dir derivative of `θ ↦ ℓ z θ g` along
                              the segment `θ₀ → θ`.
* `HasDirDerivG S`         — pointwise dir derivative of `g ↦ ℓ z θ₀ g` along
                              the segment `g₀ → g`.
* `HasMixedDirDeriv S Dθ`  — pointwise dir derivative of the *target*
                              directional-derivative datum `Dθ.dℓ_θ θ z` in
                              the nuisance variable along `g₀ → g`.

We additionally state the population first-order inequality
`FirstOrderInequality S Dθ` parameterised by a target-direction DD bundle.

See `doc/basic_concepts/po/estimation/orthogonal_statistical_learning.tex`,
`def:est-osl-system` (the first-order inequality is the closing remark of
this definition) and the preamble of `def:est-osl-neyman-loss`.

/-! # Directional Derivatives for Losses

This file packages directional derivatives of an orthogonal
statistical-learning loss in the target coordinate, the nuisance coordinate,
and the mixed target-nuisance coordinate. These derivative bundles provide the
analytic inputs used to state first-order optimality and Neyman orthogonality
for population risks.

The public bundles are `HasDirDerivTheta`, `HasDirDerivG`, and
`HasMixedDirDeriv`. The predicate `FirstOrderInequality` records the integrated
target-direction first-order condition at the true nuisance. -/

/-- **Directional derivative of the learning-system loss in the target coordinate, at a fixed
nuisance `g`.** Bundles [a candidate directional-derivative function `dℓ_θ`, giving a real number
for each target `θ` and observation `z`](hyp:dℓ_θ), the witness that [for every target `θ` in the
system's target class and every observation `z`, the loss's difference quotient along the segment
from `θ₀` to `θ` at nuisance `g` converges to `dℓ_θ θ z` as the step size shrinks to
zero](hyp:pointwise_tendsto), and [measurability of `dℓ_θ θ` in the observation for every target
`θ`](hyp:dℓ_θ_meas).

`dℓ_θ θ z` is the pointwise directional derivative value at `(θ₀, g)` in the
direction `θ - θ₀`. Its integral is an integral of these pointwise derivative values.
Identifying that integral with a directional derivative of the population risk requires a
separate limit--integral interchange theorem, which this structure does not supply. -/

/-- **Directional derivative of the learning-system loss in the nuisance coordinate.** Bundles
[a candidate pointwise directional-derivative function](hyp:dℓ_g), the witness that [the loss's
difference quotient along the segment from the distinguished nuisance to any candidate nuisance
converges pointwise to that function](hyp:pointwise_tendsto), and [measurability of each resulting
observation function](hyp:dℓ_g_meas).

`dℓ_g g z` is the pointwise directional derivative value at `(θ₀, g₀)` in the
nuisance direction `g - g₀`. Its integral is an integral of these pointwise derivative
values. Identifying that integral with a directional derivative of the population risk
requires a separate limit--integral interchange theorem, which this structure does not
supply. -/

    (S : LearningSystem Ω μ Z P_Z Θ G) where
  dℓ_g : G → Z → ℝ
  pointwise_tendsto : ∀ g ∈ S.G_set, ∀ z,
    Tendsto (fun t : ℝ =>
      (S.ℓ z S.θ₀ (S.g₀ + t • (g - S.g₀)) - S.ℓ z S.θ₀ S.g₀) / t)
      (𝓝[≠] 0) (𝓝 (dℓ_g g z))
  dℓ_g_meas         : ∀ g, Measurable (dℓ_g g)

/-- **Mixed target-nuisance directional derivative of the learning-system loss, at the truth
`(θ₀, g₀)`.** Bundles [a target-direction directional-derivative bundle `Dθ_at g` anchored at
every accessible nuisance value `g`](hyp:Dθ_at), [a real-valued mixed directional-derivative
function `dℓ_θg` of the target, the nuisance, and the observation](hyp:dℓ_θg), the witness that
[for every target `θ` and nuisance `g` in the system's classes and every observation `z`, the
target-direction derivative anchored at the perturbed nuisance `g₀ + t(g - g₀)` converges, as
`t → 0`, to `dℓ_θg θ g z`](hyp:pointwise_tendsto), and [measurability of `dℓ_θg θ g` in the
observation for every target `θ` and nuisance `g`](hyp:dℓ_θg_meas).

We package this as a *family* of target-direction directional-derivative
data — one bundle `Dθ_at g` for each accessible nuisance `g ∈ G_set ∪ {g₀}`
— together with a tendsto witness saying that the value
`(Dθ_at g').dℓ_θ θ z` at `g' := g₀ + t • (g - g₀)` differentiates in `t`
to `dℓ_θg θ g z` at `t = 0`.

Carrying the family supplies the pointwise derivative data that a future
limit--integral bridge would need to express the natural-language note's
`D_g D_θ L(θ₀, g₀)[ν_θ, ν_g]`. The structure itself asserts only pointwise
derivative facts.

`dℓ_θg θ g z` is the mixed directional derivative value at `(θ₀, g₀)` in
directions `(θ - θ₀, g - g₀)`. -/

/-- The [population first-order inequality](goal) for [an orthogonal statistical-learning
system](hyp:S) and [target-derivative data at the distinguished nuisance](hyp:Dθ) requires every
candidate target's integrated directional derivative at the distinguished target to be
nonnegative. It is a directly assumed stationarity condition; without further differentiability
and risk-convexity hypotheses, it does not characterize the distinguished target as a global
minimizer.

Parameterised over `Dθ : HasDirDerivTheta S S.g₀` so that the integral can
be expressed using the DD datum already attached to the truth. -/
