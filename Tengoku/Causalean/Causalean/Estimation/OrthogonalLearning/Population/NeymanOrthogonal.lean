# Neyman orthogonality of an orthogonal statistical-learning loss

`NeymanOrthogLoss S Dθ Dg M` says the *integrated* mixed directional
derivative `∫ M.dℓ_θg θ g z dP_Z` vanishes for every admissible target
direction `θ ∈ Θ_set` and nuisance direction `g ∈ G_set`.  This is the
loss-side analogue of `Estimation.OrthogonalMoments.NeymanOrthogonal`.

We also state difference-quotient envelope predicates
`DiffQuotientEnvelopeTheta` and `DiffQuotientEnvelopeG` for the two coordinate
directions, mirroring `Estimation.OrthogonalMoments.DiffQuotientEnvelope`.
They record domination conditions for future limit--integral bridges; no
theorem below derives such a bridge from these predicates.

Finally, `neymanOrthog_iff_score_deriv_zero` reformulates orthogonality in
terms of the map from a nuisance value to the integral of the bundled
pointwise target derivative. The required nuisance-direction limit--integral
swap is packaged as `MixedScoreDCTBridge`. Identifying this integral-valued
map with a derivative of the population risk would additionally require a
target-direction limit--integral bridge, which is not proved here.

/-! # Neyman Orthogonality for Losses

This file formulates Neyman orthogonality for an orthogonal
statistical-learning loss as the vanishing of the integrated mixed directional
derivative in every admissible target and nuisance direction. It also records
domination predicates intended for limit--integral interchange arguments.

The main predicate is `NeymanOrthogLoss`. The auxiliary predicates
`DiffQuotientEnvelopeTheta`, `DiffQuotientEnvelopeG`, and `MixedScoreDCTBridge`
package dominated-convergence hypotheses, and
`neymanOrthog_iff_score_deriv_zero` proves the score-derivative reformulation
under the bridge hypothesis. -/

/-- For [an orthogonal statistical-learning system](hyp:S) and
[mixed target--nuisance derivative data](hyp:M), the
[Neyman-orthogonality condition for the loss](goal) states that every admissible target and
nuisance direction has zero observation-law integral of its mixed directional derivative.

Neyman orthogonality of the loss: for every admissible target and
nuisance direction, the integrated mixed directional derivative at
`(θ₀, g₀)` vanishes. -/

/-- For [an orthogonal statistical-learning system](hyp:S) and
[mixed target--nuisance derivative data](hyp:M), the
[mixed-derivative limit--integral bridge](goal) says the integrated centered quotient along
every admissible nuisance perturbation tends to the integral of the corresponding mixed
directional derivative.

DCT-bridge hypothesis for the score reformulation: for every admissible
target direction `ν_θ = θ - θ₀` and nuisance direction `ν_g = g - g₀`,
the integrated centred difference quotient of the target dir derivatives
along the nuisance perturbation tends to the integrated mixed dir
derivative `∫ z, M.dℓ_θg θ g z ∂P_Z` as `t → 0` along `𝓝[≠] 0`.

A concrete sufficient envelope for these target-derivative difference
quotients is not supplied here. We package the limit conclusion directly as a
hypothesis so that the integrated-derivative reformulation can be stated
abstractly. -/

/-- **Integrated-derivative reformulation of Neyman orthogonality.** Assume
[the stated limit--integral bridge for the bundled derivatives](hyp:hBridge). Then
[Neyman orthogonality is equivalent to zero directional derivative of the integrated map](goal)
for every admissible target and nuisance direction.

Operationally, this is the statement that the difference quotient
`((Dθ_at(g₀ + t • (g - g₀))).dℓ_θ θ z - (Dθ_at g₀).dℓ_θ θ z) / t`
integrates to zero in the limit `t → 0` for every admissible `(θ, g)`,
which is exactly `NeymanOrthogLoss S M` after bridging through the mixed
DD bundle `M`.

The bridge between the integrated centred difference quotient and
`∫ z, M.dℓ_θg θ g z ∂P_Z` (DCT swap) is captured by
`MixedScoreDCTBridge S M`; under that hypothesis the iff is a routine
limit-uniqueness argument.
