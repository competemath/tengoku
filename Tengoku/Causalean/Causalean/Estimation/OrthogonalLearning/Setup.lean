# Orthogonal Statistical Learning system bundle

`LearningSystem` is the analytic core of the orthogonal statistical-learning
framework: a measurable loss `ℓ : Z → Θ → G → ℝ`, a convex target class with a
distinguished target `θ₀ ∈ Θ_set`, an admissible nuisance class with a
distinguished nuisance `g₀ ∈ G_set`, and the population-risk condition saying
that `θ₀` minimizes the true-nuisance risk over `Θ_set`.  This is the
statistical-learning parallel of `Estimation.OrthogonalMoments.GeneralMoment`:
the identification object is a *loss* (population risk minimization), not a
*moment* (population root finding).

/-! # Orthogonal Statistical Learning Setup

This file defines the basic population system for orthogonal statistical
learning: a measurable loss, a convex target class in a Hilbert space, an
admissible nuisance class, and distinguished target and nuisance elements. It
is the loss-based analogue of an orthogonal-moment model.

The central structure is `LearningSystem`. Its namespace provides the population
risk `LearningSystem.L`, and the file also exposes the segment-closure predicates
`Θ_PerturbClosed` and `G_PerturbClosed` used by later directional-derivative
modules. -/

/-- **Orthogonal statistical-learning system.** Bundles
[a convex target class containing a distinguished target](hyp:Θ_set,Θ_convex,θ₀,θ₀_mem),
[a nuisance class containing a distinguished nuisance](hyp:G_set,g₀,g₀_mem),
[a loss measurable in the observation at each fixed parameter pair](hyp:ℓ,ℓ_meas), and
[population-risk minimization by the target at the true nuisance](hyp:θ₀_minimizes).

This structure bundles the population law, a convex target class, a nuisance
class, distinguished target and nuisance elements, a measurable loss, and the
condition that the distinguished target minimizes the population risk at the
true nuisance over the target class.

* `Ω, μ`        — ambient probability space carrying the i.i.d. sample.
* `Z, P_Z`      — observation type and population law.
* `Θ, Θ_set`    — target space; `Θ_set` is a convex subset containing `θ₀`.
* `G, G_set`    — nuisance space; `G_set` contains `g₀`.
* `ℓ z θ g`     — loss evaluated at observation `z`, target `θ`,
                  nuisance `g` (note `Z` first, matching the `.tex` file's
                  `ℓ(z; θ, g)`).
* `ℓ_meas`      — measurability of `ℓ · θ g` in `z` for every fixed `θ` and `g`.
* `θ₀_minimizes` — population-risk minimization of `θ₀` over `Θ_set` at
                   the true nuisance `g₀`. -/
