# Almost-everywhere directional derivative data for an abstract `GeneralMoment`

The `HasDirDeriv` structure packages an almost-everywhere directional derivative
`dM η z` of `m(·, z, θ₀)` along the segment from `η₀` to `η`, together
with the convergence and measurability witnesses required by the DCT
bridge in `NeymanOrthogonal.lean`.

/-! # Directional Derivatives for Abstract Moments

This file packages the almost-everywhere nuisance directional derivative data required
by the abstract double machine learning framework. The data include convergence
of difference quotients along nuisance line segments and measurability of the
derivative functions. -/
