# Bundled nuisance space for the partially linear model

* `PLRNuisance γ`  — pair `(lFn, mFn)` of measurable real-valued covariate
                     functions (outcome regression and treatment regression),
                     equipped with componentwise `AddCommGroup` and `Module ℝ`
                     instances so it can serve as the nuisance space `H` of the
                     DML `GeneralMoment` framework, which requires
                     `[AddCommGroup H] [Module ℝ H]`.

Direct (but simpler) mirror of `NuisanceVec` in
`Causalean/Estimation/ATE/Score/AIPWMoment.lean`: two real-valued function fields
instead of a `Bool`-indexed regression and a propensity score.

/-! # Bundled nuisance space for the partially linear model

This file packages the two partially-linear-model nuisance functions — the
outcome regression `lFn` and the treatment regression `mFn` — together with
their measurability witnesses into a single type `PLRNuisance`, and equips it
with componentwise real-vector-space structure. This bundled nuisance space is
the nuisance space used by the partially linear double-machine-learning moment
instance. -/

/-- A partially linear nuisance bundles [an outcome regression](hyp:lFn) and a
[treatment regression](hyp:mFn) on the covariates, requiring each to be
[measurable](hyp:lMeas,mMeas).

This type is used as the abstract nuisance space for the partially linear
double-machine-learning moment functional. -/

/-- For every [covariate space](hyp:γ) equipped with a $\sigma$-algebra, [the zero operation on partially linear nuisance pairs](goal) assigns [the pair whose outcome and treatment regressions are both identically zero](step:1).

The zero nuisance pair has both the outcome regression and the treatment
regression equal to the constant zero function. -/
instance : Zero (PLRNuisance γ) where
  zero := ⟨fun _ => 0, fun _ => 0, measurable_const, measurable_const⟩

/-- For every [covariate space](hyp:γ) equipped with a $\sigma$-algebra, [the addition operation on partially linear nuisance pairs](goal) assigns [to each pair of nuisance pairs the pair obtained by adding their outcome regressions and their treatment regressions pointwise](step:1).

Addition is performed separately on the outcome regression and on the treatment
regression. -/
instance : Add (PLRNuisance γ) where
  add η η' :=
    ⟨fun x => η.lFn x + η'.lFn x,
     fun x => η.mFn x + η'.mFn x,
     η.lMeas.add η'.lMeas,
     η.mMeas.add η'.mMeas⟩

/-- For every [covariate space](hyp:γ) equipped with a $\sigma$-algebra, [the negation operation on partially linear nuisance pairs](goal) assigns [to each nuisance pair the pair obtained by negating both regressions pointwise](step:1).

Negation acts on both the outcome regression and the treatment regression. -/
instance : Neg (PLRNuisance γ) where
  neg η :=
    ⟨fun x => -η.lFn x, fun x => -η.mFn x,
     η.lMeas.neg, η.mMeas.neg⟩

/-- For every [covariate space](hyp:γ) equipped with a $\sigma$-algebra, [the subtraction operation on partially linear nuisance pairs](goal) assigns [to each ordered pair of nuisance pairs the pair obtained by subtracting their outcome regressions and their treatment regressions pointwise](step:1).

Subtraction is performed separately on the outcome regression and on the treatment
regression. -/
instance : Sub (PLRNuisance γ) where
  sub η η' :=
    ⟨fun x => η.lFn x - η'.lFn x,
     fun x => η.mFn x - η'.mFn x,
     η.lMeas.sub η'.lMeas,
     η.mMeas.sub η'.mMeas⟩

/-- For every [covariate space](hyp:γ) equipped with a $\sigma$-algebra, [the real-scalar multiplication operation on partially linear nuisance pairs](goal) assigns [to every real scalar and nuisance pair the pair obtained by multiplying both regressions pointwise by that scalar](step:1).

Scaling multiplies both the outcome regression and the treatment regression
pointwise by the scalar. -/
instance : SMul ℝ (PLRNuisance γ) where
  smul t η :=
    ⟨fun x => t * η.lFn x, fun x => t * η.mFn x,
     measurable_const.mul η.lMeas,
     measurable_const.mul η.mMeas⟩

/-- Two nuisance pairs `η` and `η'` are equal whenever [their outcome-regression
components agree at every covariate value](hyp:hl) and [their treatment-regression
components agree at every covariate value](hyp:hm), so [the two pairs are
equal](goal). -/
