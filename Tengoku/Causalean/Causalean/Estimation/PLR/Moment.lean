# The partially linear (Robinson partialling-out) orthogonal score

This file defines the Neyman-orthogonal moment for the partially linear model —
the Robinson (1988) partialling-out score — over the observed-data triple
`z = (x, d, y) : γ × ℝ × ℝ`, with nuisance `η = (ℓ, m)` a pair of measurable
covariate functions (outcome regression `ℓ` and treatment regression `m`):

    ψ(η, z, θ) = (y − ℓ(x) − θ·(d − m(x)))·(d − m(x)).

It is a *linear score* in the target `θ`: with the treatment residual
`v = d − m(x)`,

    ψ(η, z, θ) = m_a(η, z)·θ + m_b(η, z),   m_a = −v²,  m_b = (y − ℓ(x))·v.

* `plrResidual` — the treatment residual `d − m(x)`.
* `plrMomentFunctional`, `plrMomentA`, `plrMomentB` — the score and its linear
  decomposition; `plrMoment_decomp` is `ψ = m_a·θ + m_b`.
* `measurable_plrMomentFunctional`, `measurable_plrMomentA/B` — measurability in
  the data (the nuisance carries its own measurability).

/-! # Partially linear orthogonal score

This file provides the partialling-out moment functional for the partially
linear model, its decomposition into the linear-in-parameter form, and the
measurability of these maps in the data. The score is linear in the structural
slope, with coefficient minus the squared treatment residual and constant term
given by the residualized outcome times the treatment residual. -/
