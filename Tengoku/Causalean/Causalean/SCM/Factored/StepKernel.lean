# Deterministic step kernel

For the factored construction of `jointKernel`, at step `n` the value of the
next observed node `v_n = M.observedAt ⟨n, hn⟩` is produced **deterministically**
from its parent tuple by the structural function `M.structFun v_n`.  We package
this as a `Kernel.deterministic` kernel whose source is the prefix state
`FixedValues M × OrderedLatentPrefixValues M n _` and whose target is
`swigΩ Ω v_n.val`.

## Main definitions

* `SCM.stepFun hn` — the deterministic assignment
  `structFun v_n ∘ parentValuesFromPrefix hn`.
* `SCM.measurable_stepFun hn` — its measurability.
* `SCM.stepKernel hn` — `Kernel.deterministic (stepFun hn) _`.
* `SCM.isMarkov_stepKernel hn` — the `IsMarkovKernel` instance.

/-! # Step Kernels for Observed Nodes

This file constructs the deterministic kernel that generates the next observed
coordinate from its fixed, latent, and previously generated observed parents.
The step kernels are the local transition pieces in the sequential
factorization of the joint kernel, and their measurability follows from the
parent-lookup map and the SCM structural-function measurability field. -/

/-- For [a structural causal model](hyp:M) and an index $n$ [for which at

    function](goal) maps a fixed-value assignment together with the latent and
    already generated observed-prefix values to the value of the $n$-th
    observed vertex in the model's canonical topological order, by applying
    that vertex's structural function to the values of its parents. -/

-- ============================================================

/-- For [a structural causal model](hyp:M) and an index $n$ [for which at
    least $n+1$ observed vertices exist](hyp:hn), the [step kernel](goal) is
    the probability kernel that assigns unit mass to the value of the $n$-th
    observed vertex produced by its structural function from the fixed values,
    latent values, and already generated observed-prefix values.

    Since the structural assignment is deterministic and measurable, this
    kernel is the corresponding Dirac kernel. -/

model](hyp:M), [a nonnegative integer](hyp:n), and [proof that adding one to this integer does not
exceed the number of observed nodes](hyp:hn), [the Markov-kernel structure for the corresponding
deterministic step kernel](goal) asserts that the kernel assigning the next observed value from its
structural equation is a Markov kernel. -/
