/-! # Edge Type Hierarchy

This file records functional restrictions that may be attached to directed edges in
a causal graph, including nonparametric, monotone, linear, and parametric cases.
The hierarchy is separate from the probabilistic semantics of structural causal
models and is used to track functional assumptions.

## Main definitions

* `MonotonicityKind` records the four monotonicity directions.
* `EdgeType` classifies an edge as nonparametric, monotone, linear, or
  parametrically restricted.
* `EdgeType.refinesBool` and `EdgeType.refines` encode the assumption-refinement
  order in which every edge type refines the nonparametric top element.
* `EdgeTypeAssignment` attaches an `EdgeType` label to each ordered edge slot of
  a directed acyclic graph, with `EdgeTypeAssignment.allNonparametric` as the
  default assignment.

/-- [A monotonicity classification](goal) is one of
[nondecreasing](hyp:nonDecreasing), [nonincreasing](hyp:nonIncreasing),
[strictly increasing](hyp:strictlyIncreasing), or
[strictly decreasing](hyp:strictlyDecreasing).

    From the tex: "Monotonic: non-increasing, non-decreasing,
    strictly increasing, or strictly decreasing." -/

/-- [An edge-type classification](goal) is either
[nonparametric](hyp:nonparametric),
[monotonic with a specified monotonicity classification](hyp:monotonic),
[linear](hyp:linear), or [parametric](hyp:parametric).

    For any two edge-type classifications, the derived equality procedure decides
whether the first classification is equal to the second.

    From the tex (Section 2):
    1. Nonparametric: no assumption on the structural equation.
    2. Monotonic: with a specified monotonicity kind.
    3. Parametric: linear, or another named parametric family.

    `Parametric` is an opaque tag in this layer; downstream developments can
    refine it with a concrete family when they need one. -/

/-- For two edge-type assumptions, [the Boolean refinement indicator](goal) is true
exactly when the first assumption is at least as restrictive as the second: every assumption
refines the nonparametric class, matching monotonicity kinds refine one another, and linear or
parametric classes refine only their respective matching classes.

    Nonparametric is the weakest assumption: every edge type refines it. A
    linear edge refines the linear and nonparametric classes, but it is not
    automatically monotone: without a sign restriction on its coefficient, the
    linear structural function need not be strictly increasing. Returns `Bool`
    for decidability; use `refines` for the `Prop` version. -/

/-- For [two edge-type assumptions](hyp:e₁,e₂), [the refinement relation](goal) holds exactly
when their Boolean refinement indicator is true; thus the first assumption is at least as
restrictive as the second.

/-- An edge type assignment attaches [a functional-assumption label to each directed edge of a

    An edge type assignment for a DAG: a function that assigns an `EdgeType`
    to each directed edge.

    encoded via a function edgeType : E → EdgeType that assigns a type to each
    edge." -/
