/-! # Intervention Ancestry

This file relates ancestry in the graph after a set intervention to ancestry in the
original structural causal model. It supplies the graph bridge used to turn a
non-descendant condition in a back-door criterion into the non-ancestry hypothesis
needed for the library's non-ancestor Rule 3* transport.

The main theorem, `SCM.fixSet_isAncestor_fixed_forward`, lifts a directed ancestry
path starting at an intervened fixed copy in `(M.fixSet X).dag` to an ancestry
path starting at the corresponding random node in the base graph. The auxiliary
`DAG.not_isAncestor_of_root'` records that a root has no proper ancestors.

/-- **Forward direction: `.fixed D`-ancestry in `fixSet X` lifts to `.random D`-ancestry in
    the base graph.** Fix a structural causal model `M` and an intervention target set `X`
    such that [every targeted node is currently a random observed node](hyp:hX_obs) and [none
    of its fixed copies is already fixed](hyp:hX_fixed). For [a targeted node `D`](hyp:hD) and
    a node `v`, if [the fixed copy of `D` is a proper ancestor of `v` in the post-intervention
    graph obtained by fixing `X`](hyp:h), then [the random copy of `D` is a proper ancestor of
    `v` in the original base graph](goal).

    In `(M.fixSet X).dag`, the split node `.fixed D` (`D ∈ X`) has no
    incoming edges and its outgoing edges are exactly `.random D`'s
    original outgoing edges (rerouted). Interior vertices of a directed
    `.fixed D → v` path cannot be `.random d` with `d ∈ X` (which has no
    outgoing edges in `fixSet X`), nor `.fixed d` with `d ∈ X` (which is
    isolated in `M.dag`, making the IH vacuous). Consequently each step
    lifts to a corresponding base edge. -/
