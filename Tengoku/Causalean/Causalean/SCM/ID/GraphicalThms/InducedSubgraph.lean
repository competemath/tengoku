# Induced Subgraph Utilities for Identification

Thin layer on top of `Graph/Induce.lean`: defines ancestral closure and
a convenient abbreviation for producing the induced subgraph of a
`SWIGGraph`. After the April 2026 unification, the induced subgraph is
itself a `SWIGGraph`, so this file no longer needs a separate
`SubSWIGGraph` type.

## Main definitions

* `SWIGGraph.isAncestrallyClosed` — predicate stating every observed
  parent of a node in `G.observed` is itself in `G.observed`.
* `InducedFrom` — abbreviation for `G.induce R`, matching the `G_R`
  notation in the tex.

## References

* Basic Concepts.tex, Definition 2.11 (Induced subgraph), Proposition
  2.19 (ancestrally-closed hypothesis).

/-! # Induced Subgraphs for Identification

This file provides graph-level utilities for restricting a SWIG to selected
observed nodes in graphical identification arguments. It defines
`SWIGGraph.isAncestrallyClosed`, the `InducedFrom` abbreviation for `G.induce R`,
and the descendant/non-descendant sets `properDescIn` and `nonDescIn` used in
Tian-style fixing arguments, together with their basic disjointness and coverage
lemmas. -/

/-- For [a single-world intervention graph](hyp:G), [ancestral closure](goal) holds exactly when
every observed node's parent that is a random node is itself observed.

This is the graph condition used when restricting identification arguments to an
induced observed subgraph. -/

closure](goal) determines whether every parent of an observed node that is itself a random node is
also observed. -/

/-- For [a single-world intervention graph](hyp:G) and [a selected finite set of nodes](hyp:R),
[the induced subgraph](goal) is the graph obtained by restricting the original graph to those
selected nodes.

This is the graph restriction used for identification subproblems. -/

target node](hyp:v₀), [the proper-descendant set within the induced graph](goal) is the finite
set of descendants of the target in the graph induced by the selected nodes.

The descendant relation used here is already irreflexive, so the node itself is
not included. -/

It is the non-descendant conditioning set used in Tian's Lemma 1 convention. -/
