/-! # Structural Monotonicity Assumptions

This file defines monotonicity as a restriction on a structural equation itself.
The predicate fixes an observed child and one of its parents, then requires the
child's structural function to be nondecreasing in that parent coordinate while
all other parent coordinates are held fixed.

The file also contains a two-node Boolean SCM used as a sanity check: one model
satisfies the structural restriction and one model violates it. These witnesses
show that the predicate is a genuine constraint on `structFun`, not a vacuous
edge label.

/-- For [a finite collection of variables whose members can be compared for equality and that have measurable ordered value spaces](hyp:N,Ω) and [each random or fixed copy of a variable](hyp:s), [an order on that copy's value space](goal) is provided by the order on the corresponding base-variable value space, with [the random-copy case](step:1) and [the fixed-copy case](step:2) treated identically.

The random and fixed copies of a node use the same value space, so an order on
each base-variable space also orders each SWIG coordinate. -/

/-- For [a finite population of nodes with measurable ordered value spaces](hyp:N,Ω), [a child
node](hyp:child), [a parent node](hyp:parent), and [a structural causal model](hyp:M), [the
monotone-mechanism condition](goal) holds precisely when [the child is observed](step:1), the
parent is a parent of that child, and for every two parent-value assignments that agree
at all other parent coordinates and are ordered at the designated parent coordinate, the child's
structural-function value is ordered in the same direction.

`MonotoneMechanism child parent M` says that `child` is an observed node of the
model, `parent` is a parent of that child in the model's DAG, and the structural
equation for `child` is nondecreasing in the `parent` input when all other
parent inputs are held fixed. This is a restriction on the structural function,
not on the graph's edge-type labels. -/
