/-! # Hausdorff Distance for Intervals

This file develops the directed and symmetric Hausdorff distances needed for
scalar interval-valued identified sets. It proves the explicit formulas for
distances between compact real intervals that later connect interval inference
to support-function and central-limit-theorem arguments.

Main declarations:
* `directedHausdorff` and `hausdorffDist` define one-sided and symmetric
  Hausdorff distances in real-valued form.
* `infDist_Icc` computes the distance from a point to a closed real interval.
* `directedHausdorff_Icc` gives the directed interval formula.
* `hausdorffDist_Icc` gives the symmetric endpoint-gap formula
  `H([a,b],[c,d]) = max |a-c| |b-d|`.

/-- In [a pseudo-metric space](hyp:α), for [a set $A$](hyp:A) and [a set $B$](hyp:B), the
[directed, one-sided Hausdorff distance from $A$ to $B$](goal) is the supremum, over points of
$A$, of their distance to $B$; it is defined to be zero when $A$ is empty.

Real-valued (via `Metric.infDist`); on the empty image `sSup` returns `0`. -/

/-- In [a pseudo-metric space](hyp:α), for [a set $A$](hyp:A) and [a set $B$](hyp:B), the
[symmetric Hausdorff distance](goal) is the larger of the directed distance from $A$ to $B$ and
the directed distance from $B$ to $A$.

It is `H(A,B) = max(dᴴ(A,B), dᴴ(B,A))`. This is deliberately not Mathlib's
real-valued Hausdorff distance, which is `(hausdorffEDist A B).toReal` and
therefore collapses to `0` when the sets are unbounded. The
max-of-directed-distances form is the quantity the partial-identification
literature uses (Beresteanu-Molinari), and it is the one the results below are
about. -/
