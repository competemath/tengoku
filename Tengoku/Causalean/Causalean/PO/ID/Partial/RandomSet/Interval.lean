/-! # Interval Random Sets and Everywhere-Selection Expectations

This file treats an interval-valued random set as measurable lower and upper
endpoint functions and characterizes functions that belong to the interval at
every sample outcome. It proves that the integrals of integrable measurable
everywhere-selections form the interval between the endpoint expectations. This
pointwise interface is stronger than the standard almost-sure selection used to
define the Aumann expectation.

Main declarations:
* `randomInterval` and `IsSelection` encode interval-valued random sets and
  their measurable selections.
* `isSelection_iff_exists_param` parametrizes every selection as
  `L + t * (U - L)` with measurable `t : Ω -> [0,1]`.
* `selectionExpectation_eq_Icc` identifies the everywhere-selection
  expectation with `[∫ L, ∫ U]`.
* `sInf_selectionExpectation` and `sSup_selectionExpectation` recover the sharp
  lower and upper endpoints from the set of selection integrals.

/-- For [a sample space](hyp:Ω), [a lower endpoint function](hyp:L), and [an upper
endpoint function](hyp:U), the
[interval-valued random set](goal) assigns to every sample outcome the set of real numbers
that are at least its lower-endpoint value and at most its upper-endpoint value. -/

/-- For [a sample space equipped with a measurable structure](hyp:Ω), [a lower
endpoint function](hyp:L), [an upper endpoint function](hyp:U), and
[a real-valued function on the sample space](hyp:f), the [everywhere measurable-selection
condition](goal) holds precisely when [the function is measurable](step:1) and [at every
sample outcome its value lies in the closed interval between the endpoint values](step:2).

`f` is a measurable everywhere-selection of the interval random set `[L, U]`:
it is measurable and `L ω ≤ f ω ≤ U ω` for every `ω`. -/

/-- For [a sample space equipped with a measurable structure](hyp:Ω), [a lower endpoint
function](hyp:L), [an upper endpoint function](hyp:U), and [a measure on the sample

integrable measurable functions that [belong to the endpoint interval at every sample
outcome](step:1).

Unlike the standard Aumann expectation, this definition requires pointwise rather than
almost-sure membership in the random interval. -/

The forward inclusion is integral monotonicity; the reverse inclusion realizes every
