/-! # The One-Dimensional Everywhere-Selection Support Bridge

This file connects the interval produced by the everywhere-selection
expectation with support functions in the two unit directions on the real line.
The support function of `[a,b]` at `+1` is `b`, and at `-1` is `-a`; these
endpoint formulas yield scalar support-expectation identities and the interval
Hausdorff identity. The selection interface used here requires membership at
every outcome, not merely almost surely.

Main declarations:
* `supportFn_Icc_one` and `supportFn_Icc_neg_one` compute support functions of
  real intervals at the two unit directions.
* `hausdorffDist_Icc_eq_supportFn` rewrites interval Hausdorff distance in the
  `d = 1` support-function form.
* `artstein_supportFn_one` and `artstein_supportFn_neg_one` prove endpoint
  support-expectation identities for `selectionExpectation`.
