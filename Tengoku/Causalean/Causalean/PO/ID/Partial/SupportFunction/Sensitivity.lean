# Reweighting / sensitivity models — applications of the support-function engine

A *sensitivity analysis* replaces an unidentified nuisance — typically a
reweighting `w` of the observed law that would recover the causal estimand under
unconfoundedness — by an **ambiguity set** `W` of admissible weights, and reports
the range of the linear target `w ↦ ⟪c, w⟫` (the reweighted mean) over `W`.  This
is exactly the support-function picture of `SupportFunction/Interval.lean`, so the
sharp robust bounds are

    robustLower W c = -supportFn W (-c)   ≤   ⟪c, w⟫   ≤   supportFn W c = robustUpper W c,

an interval whose width is `width W c`.  The first half of this file fixes that
vocabulary and records the two structural facts every sensitivity model uses: the
bounds are **monotone in the ambiguity budget** (a larger admissible set `W ⊆ W'`
widens the interval) and they **collapse to a point** when there is no ambiguity
(`W = {w₀}`), recovering the identified value `⟪c, w₀⟫`.

The second half instantiates a concrete budget — the **χ²/L² divergence ball**.
A reweighting constrained to this ball is a **ball around the base weight**
measured in the ambient inner product, together with the normalization that `w`
integrates to one against the base direction `e` (here `‖e‖ = 1`, the unit
"constant"):

    l2Ball e ρ = { w | ⟪e, w⟫ = 1  ∧  ‖w - e‖ ≤ ρ }.

(Reading `e` as the constant function and `c` as the centred outcome `Y` in
`L²(P)`, `⟪e, w⟫ = 1` is `𝔼_P[w] = 1` and `‖w - e‖² = χ²(Q‖P)`; the set is the
signed-reweighting relaxation of the χ²-ball.)

Substituting `v = w - e` turns this into the affine-ball fiber of
`SupportFunction/AffineBall.lean` for the operator `A = innerSL ℝ e` with `b = 0`
and minimum-norm solution `h₀ = 0`, so the support function is computed by the
engine.  Identifying `ker A = (ℝ ∙ e)ᗮ` and the orthogonal split
`‖c‖² = ‖P_{ℝ∙e} c‖² + ‖P_{(ℝ∙e)ᗮ} c‖²` (`‖P_{ℝ∙e} c‖ = |⟪e,c⟫|` under `‖e‖=1`)
collapse the closed form to the classic **mean ± `ρ · SD`** band

    supportFn (l2Ball e ρ) c = ⟪e, c⟫ + ρ · √(‖c‖² − ⟪e, c⟫²),

a width `2ρ · √(‖c‖² − ⟪e, c⟫²)` that collapses to a point exactly when `c` is
collinear with `e` (the outcome is `P`-a.e. constant), i.e. equality in
Cauchy–Schwarz.

## Main definitions

* `robustUpper` / `robustLower` — the sharp upper/lower robust bounds of the
  reweighted mean over an ambiguity set.
* `l2Ball` — the χ²/L² ambiguity set.

## Main results

* `robustLower_le_robustUpper` — the robust interval is nonempty (well-ordered).
* `robustUpper_mono` / `robustLower_antitone` — a larger ambiguity set widens the
  interval (monotonicity in the budget).
* `robustUpper_singleton` / `robustLower_singleton` — no ambiguity ⇒ point
  identification at `⟪c, w₀⟫`.
* `robustInterval_eq_image` — for a compact convex `W` the robust interval is
  exactly the identified set of the reweighted mean.
* `l2Ball_eq_translate` — the χ²-ball is the affine-ball fiber translated by `e`.
* `supportFn_l2Ball_eq` — the `mean + ρ·SD` closed-form worst case.
* `width_l2Ball_eq` — the closed-form width `2ρ·SD`.
* `l2Ball_point_identified_iff` — point identification ⇔ `‖c‖² = ⟪e,c⟫²`
  (outcome collinear with the constant).

/-! # Support-function sensitivity models

This file applies the support-function engine to sensitivity analysis with
reweighted means. It defines robust upper and lower bounds over ambiguity sets,
records their monotonicity and singleton collapse properties, and computes the
closed form for the chi-square/L2-ball relaxation.
