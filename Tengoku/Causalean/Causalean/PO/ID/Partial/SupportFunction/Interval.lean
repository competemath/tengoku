# The identified interval of a linear target over a convex set

This is the payoff of the support-function spine.  When the feasible set `C` is
**convex** and the target is the **linear functional** `x ↦ ⟪d, x⟫`, the sharp
identified set of the target value is the closed interval

    [ -supportFn C (-d), supportFn C d ].

The lower endpoint `-supportFn C (-d)` is the infimum (worst case) and the upper
endpoint `supportFn C d` is the supremum (best case) of the functional over the
nuisance set `C`.  Sharpness — that *every* intermediate value is attained — is
exactly order-connectedness of the image, which holds because the linear image of
a convex set is convex (hence an interval) in `ℝ`.

This generalises the one-dimensional `IdentifiedSet` engine of
`PartialID/Basic.lean`: `identifiedInterval_eq_image` shows the scalar engine's
identified set *is* this linear image, so concrete theorems may consume either
vocabulary.

## Main results

* `neg_supportFn_neg_le` — the lower endpoint bounds the functional from below.
* `linearImage_subset_Icc` — the identified set sits inside `[-h(-d), h(d)]`.
* `linearImage_ordConnected` — convexity makes the identified set order-connected.
* `linearImage_eq_Icc` — *sharp* interval, given the endpoints are attained.
* `linearImage_eq_Icc_of_isCompact` — sharp interval for a compact convex set
  (endpoints automatically attained; the workhorse for finite-dimensional sets).
* `width` / `width_nonneg` — the width `h(d) + h(-d) ≥ 0` of the identified set.
* `width_eq_zero_iff` — **point identification**: zero width iff the target is
  constant on `C`.
* `identifiedInterval_eq_image` — bridge to the scalar `IdentifiedSet` engine.

/-! # Support-Function Identified Intervals

This file characterizes the sharp interval of values attained by a linear target over a
convex feasible set. It connects the support-function description of the lower and upper
endpoints to the scalar identified-interval machinery used elsewhere in the
partial-identification library. -/
