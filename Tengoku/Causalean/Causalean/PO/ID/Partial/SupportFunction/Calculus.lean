# Support-function calculus

The algebraic rules for `supportFn` (`PartialID/SupportFunction/Basic.lean`).
These let a downstream sharpness proof *compute* the endpoints of a composite
feasible set (unions of nuisance regimes, Minkowski sums of independent
uncertainty, scaled/translated reweighting classes) by reducing to support
functions of the pieces, rather than re-running a `csSup` argument each time.

All statements carry the `Nonempty`/`BddAbove` side conditions that the real
`sSup` requires; over compact feasible sets these are automatic
(`linearImage_eq_Icc_of_isCompact` in `Interval.lean`).

## Main results

* `supportFn_singleton` — support function of a point is the functional value.
* `supportFn_nonneg_of_zero_mem` — `0 ∈ C` forces a nonnegative support value.
* `supportFn_smul_dir` — positive homogeneity in the direction.
* `supportFn_add_dir_le` — subadditivity in the direction (sublinearity).
* `supportFn_mono` — monotone in the set.
* `supportFn_union` — support function of a union is the `max`.
* `supportFn_inter_le` — support function of an intersection is `≤` the `min`.
* `supportFn_translate` — translating the set shifts the support value.
* `supportFn_smul_set` — scaling the set by `a ≥ 0` scales the support value.
* `supportFn_minkowski` — additive over Minkowski sums.

/-! # Support-function calculus

This file proves algebraic rules for support functions of convex identified
sets: singleton evaluation, homogeneity, subadditivity, monotonicity, unions,
intersections, translations, scaling, and Minkowski sums. These rules let
downstream partial-identification proofs compute robust interval endpoints
compositionally.
