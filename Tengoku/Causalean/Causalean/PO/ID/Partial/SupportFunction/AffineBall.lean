# Sharp endpoints over an affine subspace intersected with a ball

The canonical Hilbert-space partial-identification program: a target functional
`⟪c, ·⟫` optimized over the *bridge fiber* — the solutions of a linear equation
`A h = b` (observed-data constraints) that also satisfy a norm bound `‖h‖ ≤ B`
(an L²-size restriction replacing the usual sup-norm box).  This is exactly the
proximal-L2-bridge identified set (`pid_proximal_l2_bridge`).

Writing `h = h₀ + v` with `h₀` the minimum-norm solution (`h₀ ⊥ ker A`) and
`v ∈ ker A` the free direction, the Pythagorean split `‖h‖² = ‖h₀‖² + ‖v‖²`
turns the program into maximizing `⟪c, v⟫` over `v ∈ ker A`, `‖v‖² ≤ B² − ‖h₀‖²`.
Only the `ker A`-component `P c = orthogonalProjection (ker A) c` of `c` matters,
and Cauchy–Schwarz gives the closed form

    supportFn (affineBall A b B) c = ⟪c, h₀⟫ + √(B² − ‖h₀‖²) · ‖P c‖,

a width `2√(B² − ‖h₀‖²)·‖P c‖`, with **point collapse** `width = 0 ⇔ P c = 0`,
i.e. `c ⊥ ker A` (equivalently `c` lies in the closed row space of `A`).

## Main results

* `opKer` / `affineBall` — the free-direction subspace `ker A` and the feasible fiber.
* `supportFn_affineBall_eq` — the closed-form support value.
* `width_affineBall_eq` — the closed-form width.
* `affineBall_point_identified_iff` — point identification `⇔ P c = 0`.

/-! # Support bounds for an affine ball

This file solves the support-function problem for a linear functional over the
intersection of an affine solution set and a Hilbert-space ball. It defines the
free-direction kernel `opKer` and feasible set `affineBall`, proves the
closed-form endpoint `supportFn_affineBall_eq`, derives the width formula
`width_affineBall_eq`, and characterizes point identification by
`affineBall_point_identified_iff`.

between real inner-product spaces, `b` a target value, `B` a radius, and `c` a direction. Suppose
[`h₀` solves the linear constraint `A h₀ = b`](hyp:hsol), [`h₀` is orthogonal to the kernel of `A`
(the minimum-norm solution)](hyp:hperp), and [`h₀`'s norm is at most `B` (`h₀` fits the
