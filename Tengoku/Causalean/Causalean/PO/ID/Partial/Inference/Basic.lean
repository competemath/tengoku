# Inference for interval-identified parameters: coverage vocabulary

Every interval-identification theorem in this library produces a *population
sandwich* `L ≤ θ₀ ≤ U` (Manski, Balke–Pearl, Lee, Proxy, …; see
`Causalean.PO.ID.Partial.Basic`). Turning such bounds into a **confidence interval**
forces a choice that does not arise under point identification: should the random
interval cover the whole identified set `[L, U]`, or only the (single, unknown)
true value `θ₀ ∈ [L, U]`?  These are the two coverage notions of the partial-ID
inference literature:

* **Coverage of the identified set** (Horowitz–Manski 2000): the random interval
  contains all of `[L, U]`.  Formalized here as `RandomCoversIcc`.
* **Coverage of the parameter** (Imbens–Manski 2004): the random interval
  contains the point `θ₀`.  Formalized here as `RandomCoversPoint`.

As Imbens–Manski (2004, Lemma 1) observe, when `[L, U]` is not a singleton the
two notions genuinely differ, and confidence sets for the *point* are weakly
*smaller* than those for the *set*.  The easy direction — set coverage implies
point coverage, so a set-honest interval is automatically point-honest — is
`randomCoversIcc_subset_randomCoversPoint` below.

This file is pure measure theory: it has no dependency on the potential-outcome
framework, mirroring `PartialID/Basic.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `RandomCoversPoint A B θ` — the event that the random interval `[A ω, B ω]`
  contains the fixed value `θ`.
* `RandomCoversIcc A B L U` — the event that `A ω ≤ L` and `U ≤ B ω`; when
  `L ≤ U`, this means that `[A ω, B ω]` contains the whole interval `[L, U]`.

## Main results

* `randomCoversIcc_subset_randomCoversPoint` — for `θ ∈ [L, U]`, set coverage
  implies point coverage (the easy half of Imbens–Manski Lemma 1).
* `honest_ci_set_cover` — the **abstract honest-CI lemma**: if the lower endpoint
  overshoots after widening with probability `≤ δ_L` and the upper endpoint
  undershoots after widening with probability `≤ δ_U`, then the widened interval
  `[L̂ − w_L, Û + w_U]` covers `[L, U]` with probability `≥ 1 − δ_L − δ_U`
  (a one-line union bound over the two one-sided endpoint-failure events).
* `honest_ci_point_cover` — the parameter-coverage corollary obtained by composing
  the previous two results.

/-! # Coverage Vocabulary for Interval-Identified Parameters

This file defines the two coverage events used for confidence intervals around an
interval-identified scalar parameter: coverage of a fixed parameter value and
coverage of a nonempty identified interval. `RandomCoversPoint A B theta` is the
sample event that the random interval `[A omega, B omega]` contains `theta`;
`RandomCoversIcc A B L U` is the event that its endpoints satisfy `A omega ≤ L`
and `U ≤ B omega`; for `L ≤ U`, this is coverage of the whole population
identified interval `[L, U]`.

Population bounds used with `RandomCoversIcc` are required to satisfy `L ≤ U`;
under that condition its endpoint inequalities are equivalent to literal set
containment. The theorem `randomCoversIcc_subset_randomCoversPoint` records the elementary
Horowitz-Manski to Imbens-Manski implication: set coverage implies point
coverage for every true value inside `[L, U]`. The endpoint lemmas
`lowerOvershoot_subset_absMiss` and `upperUndershoot_subset_absMiss`, together
with `randomCoversIcc_compl_subset`, isolate the two one-sided failure events
used by concentration-based intervals. The abstract theorems
`honest_ci_set_cover` and `honest_ci_point_cover` then prove honest set and
parameter coverage from upper bounds on those endpoint miss probabilities. -/

/-- For [a sample space](hyp:Ω), [a lower endpoint function](hyp:A),
[an upper endpoint function](hyp:B), and [a fixed real parameter value](hyp:θ),
the [parameter-coverage event](goal) is the set of
sample outcomes at which the random interval with those endpoints contains that value.

**Coverage of the parameter** (Imbens–Manski notion).  The event that the
random interval `[A ω, B ω]` contains the fixed real value `θ`.

This is a *sampling-level* object — a (random) subset of the sample space `Ω`,
indexed by the data-dependent endpoints `A, B` — not to be confused with the
*population* identified set `Causalean.Stat.AttainableSet.IdentifiedSet`.  Even under point
identification (`L = U`, identified set a singleton), this remains the coverage
event of the random confidence interval, which is the whole point of inference. -/

  {ω | A ω ≤ θ ∧ θ ≤ B ω}

/-- For [a sample space](hyp:Ω), [a lower endpoint function](hyp:A),
[an upper endpoint function](hyp:B), [a real lower bound](hyp:L), and
[a real upper bound](hyp:U), the [endpoint-coverage event](goal) is the set of
sample outcomes at which the random endpoints satisfy the two corresponding
inequalities. When the lower bound is at most the upper bound, this means that
the random interval contains the entire closed interval between them.

**Coverage of the identified set** (Horowitz–Manski notion).  The event that
the random interval `[A ω, B ω]` satisfies the endpoint inequalities
`A ω ≤ L` and `U ≤ B ω`. When `L ≤ U`, this is equivalent to containing
the whole population interval `[L, U]`; callers claiming set coverage must supply
that order condition. -/
def RandomCoversIcc (A B : Ω → ℝ) (L U : ℝ) : Set Ω :=
  {ω | A ω ≤ L ∧ U ≤ B ω}

/-- **Set coverage ⟹ point coverage** (the easy half of Imbens–Manski 2004,
Lemma 1).  If the true value `θ` lies in the identified set `[L, U]`, then every
sample realization whose random interval covers all of `[L, U]` also covers `θ`.
Consequently a confidence interval that is honest for the *set* is automatically
honest for the *parameter* — which is why parameter-coverage intervals can be no
larger, and generically strictly smaller. -/

/-- **Abstract honest confidence interval (set coverage).** Let `lo`, `hi` be the
(random) lower/upper endpoint estimators of the population bounds `L`, `U`, with [`lo`
measurable](hyp:hlo) and [`hi` measurable](hyp:hhi). Suppose [the probability that the
widened lower endpoint `lo − wL` overshoots `L` is at most `δL`](hyp:hML), and [the
probability that the widened upper endpoint `hi + wU` undershoots `U` is at most
`δU`](hyp:hMU). Then [the
widened random interval `[lo − wL, hi + wU]` covers the entire identified set
`[L, U]` with probability at least `1 − δL − δU`](goal).

This is a conservative partial-ID analogue of the Horowitz–Manski (2000)
confidence region, proved by a single union bound over the two
one-sided endpoint-failure events. The union bound needs no ordering of `L` and
`U`; the conclusion is read as coverage of the identified set in the intended
regime `L ≤ U`, and remains a true statement about the two endpoint inequalities
otherwise. It is stated
abstractly in the miss probabilities so that any concentration inequality
(Hoeffding, Bernstein, …) can be plugged in; see `Inference/IntervalCI.lean`. -/

Obtained by composing `honest_ci_set_cover` with
`randomCoversIcc_subset_randomCoversPoint`: covering the set is sufficient for
covering any point of it.  This is the conservative (Horowitz–Manski-style)
parameter confidence interval; the sharper Imbens–Manski interval, which replaces
the two-sided half-widths by one-sided critical values when `U − L > 0`, is in
`Inference/ImbensManski.lean`. -/
