# Hausdorff consistency of normalized criterion-function set estimators

Companion to `CriterionSet/Basic.lean`.  Given a population criterion `Q` with
nonempty identified set `Θ_I = {Q = 0}` and a sample criterion `Qn` close to
`Q` in the sup-norm (the uniform-convergence input supplied by a ULLN /
Glivenko–Cantelli argument), the level-set estimator `Θ̂ₙ = {Qn ≤ cₙ}` converges
to `Θ_I` in Hausdorff distance.

The mathematical core is the **deterministic rate bound**: under a *linear
minorant* `δ · d(θ, Θ_I) ≤ Q θ` (the CHT polynomial-minorant identifiability
condition, degree `γ = 1`), a sup-norm error `ε` and a cutoff `c ≥ ε`,

    H(Θ̂ₙ, Θ_I) ≤ (c + ε) / δ.

Both directions are elementary: points of `Θ̂ₙ` cannot be far from `Θ_I` (the
minorant forces `d(θ, Θ_I) ≤ (c+ε)/δ`), and `Θ_I ⊆ Θ̂ₙ` outright (`Q = 0 ⇒
Qn ≤ ε ≤ c`).  Consistency `H(Θ̂ₙ, Θ_I) → 0` is then a squeeze from `cₙ, εₙ → 0`.

This uses the symmetric and one-sided distances from `RandomSet/Hausdorff.lean`,
tying the two partial-ID inference pillars to one geometry.

/-! # Hausdorff consistency for criterion-set estimators

This file proves deterministic Hausdorff-distance bounds for level sets of
sample criterion functions, as a normalized zero-set specialization of the
Chernozhukov-Hong-Tamer criterion-set consistency argument. The population identified set is
`identifiedSet Q = {theta | Q theta = 0}`, the sample estimator is
`levelSet Qn c = {theta | Qn theta <= c}`, and the key identifiability
condition is `LinearMinorant Q delta`, a linear lower bound on criterion values
in terms of distance to the identified set.

The main theorem `hausdorffDist_levelSet_le` states that a uniform sup-norm
error bound `|Qn - Q| <= epsilon`, a cutoff `epsilon <= c`, and a positive
minorant modulus `delta` imply
`hausdorffDist (levelSet Qn c) (identifiedSet Q) <= (c + epsilon) / delta`.
The consistency theorem `tendsto_hausdorffDist_levelSet` turns this deterministic
bound into Hausdorff convergence when both the cutoff and the uniform error
vanish. The file also supplies reusable helpers for nonnegativity and subset
control of `directedHausdorff` and `hausdorffDist`.

/-! ## The CHT criterion-set consistency results -/

/-- For [a parameter space with a pseudometric](hyp:Θ), [a criterion
function](hyp:Q), and [a real modulus](hyp:δ), the [linear-minorant
condition](goal) holds precisely when, for every parameter value, [the modulus
times its distance from the criterion's zero set is no greater than its
criterion value](step:1).

A criterion `Q` satisfies a **linear minorant** with modulus `δ` relative to
its identified set: `δ · d(θ, Θ_I) ≤ Q θ` for all `θ`.  This is the
Chernozhukov–Hong–Tamer (2007) polynomial-minorant identifiability condition of
degree `γ = 1` — it forces `Q` to grow at least linearly away from `Θ_I`, so a
small criterion value pins `θ` near the identified set. -/
def LinearMinorant (Q : Θ → ℝ) (δ : ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∀ θ, δ * Metric.infDist θ (identifiedSet Q) ≤ Q θ

/-- **Deterministic normalized-criterion rate bound.** Fix [a positive
linear-minorant modulus `δ`](hyp:hδ), [a nonnegative sup-norm error bound
`ε`](hyp:hε), and [a cutoff `c` at least `ε`](hyp:hc). If [the population
criterion `Q` satisfies a linear minorant of modulus `δ` relative to its
identified set — `δ` times the distance to the identified set never exceeds
`Q`](hyp:hmin), and [the sample criterion `Qn` is within `ε` of `Q` in sup norm at every
point](hyp:hunif), then [the level-set estimator `{Qn ≤ c}` is within
Hausdorff distance `(c + ε) / δ` of the population identified set
`{Q = 0}`](goal):

    H(levelSet Qn c, identifiedSet Q) ≤ (c + ε) / δ.

The positive linear minorant makes `Q` nonnegative, so any attained zero is a
population minimizer and the zero set is the argmin set. -/
