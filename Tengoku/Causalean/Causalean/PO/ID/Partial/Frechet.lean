# Fréchet–Hoeffding copula bounds and the easy-direction Makarov bound

This file proves, for a fixed joint law of two real random variables `X, Y` on a
probability space, the classical Fréchet–Hoeffding bounds on the joint CDF and the
*easy* (lower) direction of the Makarov bound on the CDF of the difference `X - Y`.

All quantities are written as `.toReal` of measures of the relevant events, e.g.
the joint CDF value is `(P {ω | X ω ≤ u ∧ Y ω ≤ v}).toReal`.

## Main results

* `frechet_upper` — `P(X ≤ u, Y ≤ v) ≤ min (P(X ≤ u)) (P(Y ≤ v))`.
* `frechet_lower` — `max (P(X ≤ u) + P(Y ≤ v) - 1) 0 ≤ P(X ≤ u, Y ≤ v)`.
* `makarov_lower_param` — per-threshold lower bound on the CDF of `X - Y`:
  `max (P(X ≤ a) - P(Y < a - s)) 0 ≤ P(X - Y ≤ s)`.
* `makarov_lower_iSup` — the sup-convolution envelope form of the Makarov lower bound.

These are exactly the directions provable from a *fixed* joint distribution. We do
**not** assert sharpness/attainability of these bounds (that is Makarov's hard
theorem and is out of scope here).

/-! # Fréchet-Hoeffding and Makarov Bounds

This file establishes Fréchet–Hoeffding bounds for the joint cumulative distribution
function of two real-valued random variables under a fixed joint probability law, and
an elementary lower Makarov bound for the cumulative distribution function of their difference.

The results apply to an already fixed coupling and do not establish the sharp
attainability part of Makarov's theorem, which requires construction of extremal couplings. -/
