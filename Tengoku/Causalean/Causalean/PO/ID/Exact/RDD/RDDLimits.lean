/-! # RDD One-Sided Limits

This file provides the one-sided limit engine used by sharp and fuzzy
regression-discontinuity identification. If two real-valued functions agree
almost everywhere on the relevant side of a cutoff and the reference function
is continuous at the cutoff, then any corresponding one-sided limit of the
other function equals the reference value at the cutoff, provided the running
variable law has positive mass arbitrarily close to that side.

Theorems `oneSidedLimit_eq_right` and `oneSidedLimit_eq_left` identify
right- and left-hand limits from one-sided a.e. agreement. The pointwise
versions `value_eq_of_aeEq_right` and `value_eq_of_aeEq_left` identify the
cutoff values of two continuous representatives. These results isolate the
topological and measure-theoretic argument from the causal RDD files. -/

/-- [Almost-everywhere agreement on the right half-line](hyp:h_aeEq) and [positive
running-variable mass in every right neighborhood](hyp:h_support) ensure that [each
positive-width neighborhood](hyp:hε) [contains a point where the two regression
representatives agree](goal); this supplies the sequence of agreement points needed for
cutoff-limit identification. -/
