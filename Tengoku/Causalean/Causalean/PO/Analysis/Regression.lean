# Regression-function representatives

A lightweight predicate `IsRegressionFunction μ X g f` saying that `f : ℝ → ℝ`
represents `E[g | X = ·]` via the integral identity on every measurable slice
`X ⁻¹' A`, with `X` required to be almost-everywhere measurable. Used by the
RDD-style identification theorems (sharp and fuzzy).

The general measurable-preimage characterization of conditional expectation
lives in `Causalean.Mathlib.MeasureTheory.CondExpPreimage`. This predicate is a
specialized interface for theorem statements that only require a concrete
regression representative; no adapter between the two interfaces is provided
in this file.

/-! # Regression Function Representatives

This file provides a measure-theoretic predicate saying that a real function is
a concrete representative of a conditional mean of one real random variable
given another. The predicate is used as a lightweight interface in
RDD-style potential-outcome identification statements.

The central structure is `IsRegressionFunction μ X g f`, which requires
almost-everywhere measurability of the conditioning variable, measurability of
the representative, integrability, and equality of slice integrals over every
measurable event in the range of `X`. The file also proves pushforward
integrability of representatives, closure under subtraction, and
almost-everywhere equality of two representatives when the represented
responses are a.e. equal. The general conditional-expectation characterization
for measurable preimages is in `Causalean.Mathlib.MeasureTheory.CondExpPreimage`;
this file does not yet connect the two APIs. -/

/-- A regression-function representative for the conditional mean of a response `g`
given a [conditioning variable `X` that is `μ`-almost-everywhere
measurable](hyp:aemeasurable_conditioner): a candidate function `f` on the real
line that is [measurable](hyp:measurable), for which [the response `g` is
integrable](hyp:integrable_response) and [the composite `f ∘ X` is
integrable](hyp:integrable_compose), and such that [the integral of `g` over every
measurable event determined by `X` equals the integral of `f ∘ X` over that same
event](hyp:integral_preimage_eq).

This is a concrete representative of the regression function `E[g | X = x]`,
encoded by the integral identity on every measurable slice of `X`. -/
