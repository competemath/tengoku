# Invariant Causal Prediction — non-descendant invariance

The structural backbone of the mean-shift argument (`propos:sem`): under a single
do-intervention `do(X_{k₀} = a)`, every coordinate that is **not a descendant of
`k₀`** and is not `k₀` itself keeps its observational value a.e.

`nonDescendant_invariance` proves, for the single-intervention environment
`e` with `A = {k₀}`, that `e.X ω k = M.X ω k` a.e. for every `k ≠ k₀` with
`¬ dag.isAncestor k₀ k` (i.e. `k` is not a strict descendant of `k₀`).  This
includes nodes incomparable with `k₀` and ancestors of `k₀`, exactly the
"upstream + sideways" part of the graph the intervention cannot reach; the
intervened node `k₀` is excluded because it is pinned to the assigned constant.

The proof is a strong induction along the topological order: each such `k`
satisfies the *same* structural equation in both worlds (`hDoStruct k` vs
`hε k`, since `k ≠ k₀` so `k ∉ A`), and all its parents are also non-descendants
of `k₀` with strictly smaller topological order, so they agree by induction.

/-- **Non-descendant invariance.**  Let `e` be an environment of the observational
SEM `M` in which [the single intervened coordinate is `k₀`](hyp:hA). Then [every
coordinate `k` that is neither `k₀` nor a descendant of `k₀` in the observational
DAG keeps its observational value almost surely: `Xₖᵉ = Xₖ¹`](goal). (The node
`k₀` itself is pinned to the assigned constant, hence excluded.) -/
