# Invariant Causal Prediction — residual equals the target noise

Algebraic helper lemmas for the completeness proof: with the *causal* coefficient
`γ* = β₀,·`, the regression residual `Y − Σ_k γ*_k X_k` equals the target noise
`ε₀` a.e. in every environment.

* `obsResidual_eq_eps` — observational block: from `hε` at the target row.
* `envResidual_eq_eps` — interventional block: from `hDoStruct` at the target
  (the target is never intervened on, so it keeps its structural equation).

Both use that the target's own coefficient is `0` (`hNoSelf`) to turn the
`Σ_{k≠0}` of the structural equation into the full `Σ_k` of the residual.

/-- [The causal coefficient vector](goal) extracts the target equation's coefficients from [an
observational linear-Gaussian SEM](hyp:M) with [predictor dimension `p`](hyp:p), making its
regression residual coincide with target noise. -/

/-- With the causal coefficient, the full-sum `Σ_k β₀ₖ X_k` equals the
structural-equation sum `Σ_{k≠0} β₀ₖ X_k`, since `β₀₀ = 0`. -/

/-- **Interventional residual is the target noise.** For [an observational SEM](hyp:M) and
[a do-intervention environment built on it](hyp:e) — where the target is never itself
intervened on, so it keeps its structural equation — [the environment residual
