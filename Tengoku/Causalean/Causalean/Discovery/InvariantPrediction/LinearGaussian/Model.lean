# Invariant Causal Prediction — linear-Gaussian model layer

Setup for a specialization of the **linear-Gaussian** identifiability theorem of
Peters, Bühlmann & Meinshausen, *Causal inference using invariant prediction*
(JRSS-B 2016, `arXiv:1501.01332`), Theorem 2(i) (the **do-intervention** version).
Unlike the paper's recursive-SEM formulation, this encoding separately assumes
the target-exogeneity facts used by soundness.

This is a *self-contained* linear-Gaussian framework, deliberately separate from
the nonparametric SWIG/kernel `EnvFamily` development in the parent directory.
Variables are real functions on a probability space, with `∫`/`E[·]` for moments
and `IdentDistrib` for equality in distribution.

## Encoding choices

* **Index convention.**  The paper uses variables `X₁,…,X_{p+1}` with target
  `Y = X₁` and predictors `X₂,…,X_{p+1}`.  We index nodes by `Fin (p+1)` and put
  the **target at index `0`**, predictors at `1,…,p`.  So `target = 0` and the
  predictor index set is `{1,…,p} = {k : k ≠ 0}` (`Finset.univ.erase 0`).  This
  is a pure 0-based relabelling of the paper's `1,…,p+1`; `PA(Y)` is then a
  subset of `{k : k ≠ 0}`.

* **One coefficient matrix, one DAG.**  The observational SEM `e = 1`
  (`eq:semmmmm`) carries the coefficients `β : Matrix (Fin (p+1)) (Fin (p+1)) ℝ`
  with `Xⱼ = Σ_{k≠j} βⱼₖ Xₖ + εⱼ`.  Acyclicity is witnessed by a `DAG` whose
  edge `k → j` holds exactly when `βⱼₖ ≠ 0` (`hEdge`); reusing `Causalean.Graph.DAG`
  gives parents / descendants / topological order / the "youngest node" notion
  for free.  `PA(Y) = {k : β 0 k ≠ 0}` is then literally `dag.parents 0`.

* **Gaussian noise, random-variable form.**  The observational SEM has its own
  probability space with observed coordinates, and do-intervention environments
  live on that same probability space with the same structural noises.
  Independence of the noises and their Gaussian marginals are stated on the
  *observational* environment only (that is where the graph/`β`/Gaussianity live).

* **Do-interventions (`sec:idfirst`).**  In environment `e` an intervention set
  `A e ⊆ {1,…,p}` and values `a e : Fin (p+1) → ℝ` replace the structural
  equation of each `j ∈ A e` by the constant `a e j` (zeroing its row of `β` and
  replacing `εⱼ` by `a e j`).  Per the paper, `0 ∉ A e` (never intervene on the
  target) and `A 1 = ∅` (observational).

The do-version's proof in `Completeness.lean` is a **mean-shift** argument
(`R^{e₀} = α_{k₀} a_{k₀} + …` vs. `R^1 = α_{k₀} X_{k₀}^1 + …`, eq:help1/help2),
so the model exposes residual means / laws cleanly via `IdentDistrib` and `∫`.

/-- **The observational linear-Gaussian structural equation model** (`eq:semmmmm`, the
`e = 1` block): it bundles [a sample space with its σ-algebra](hyp:Ω,mΩ) carrying [a
probability measure](hyp:P) that [is a genuine probability measure](hyp:hP), together with
[structural coefficients `β`](hyp:β) obeying `Xⱼ = Σ_{k≠j} βⱼₖ Xₖ + εⱼ` for [measurable
observed coordinates `X`](hyp:X,hXmeas), an [acyclic graph whose edge `k → j` holds exactly
when `βⱼₖ ≠ 0`](hyp:dag,hEdge), and [the absence of self-loops in `β`](hyp:hNoSelf). The
noises `ε` are declared to be [the structural residuals `εⱼ = Xⱼ − Σ_{k≠j} βⱼₖ Xₖ`](hyp:ε,hε),
[jointly independent](hyp:hindep), and [each centered Gaussian with a positive variance
`σⱼ²`](hyp:σ,hσpos,hGauss), and [the target's noise is independent of every parent
coordinate of the target](hyp:hYexo).

It fixes the structural coefficients `β` (with `Xⱼ = Σ_{k≠j} βⱼₖ Xₖ + εⱼ`), the
acyclic graph whose edge `k → j` is `βⱼₖ ≠ 0`, the noise variances `σ²`, and the
joint law on its own probability space `Ω`: the coordinates solve the structural
equations a.e., the noises `ε` are jointly independent `N(0, σⱼ²)`, and they are
the structural residuals `εⱼ = Xⱼ − Σ_{k≠j} βⱼₖ Xₖ`.  This is the only block that
carries the graph, the coefficients and the Gaussianity. -/

  of `Y`, so they are functions of noises other than `ε₀` — but the random-variable
  encoding here does not expose the `ε → X` solve `X = (I−B)⁻¹ε`, so we carry it as
  a field.  It is stated **only for parents** of the target: it is *false* for

/-- **A single do-intervention environment** for the observational SEM `M` (`sec:idfirst`)
bundles [an intervention set that never includes the target node](hyp:A,hAtarget), [the
constant values assigned to each intervened coordinate](hyp:a), and [measurable
post-intervention coordinates](hyp:X,hXmeas) that [equal their assigned constant, almost
surely, on the intervened set](hyp:hDoPin), [satisfy the same structural equation as `M` —
with `M`'s coefficients and noises — on every coordinate left un-intervened](hyp:hDoStruct),
and for which [the target's noise remains independent of each parent coordinate of the
target](hyp:hExo).

Faithful do-semantics (modularity / autonomy): the environment is the
observational SEM with the structural equations of the intervened nodes `A`
replaced by the assigned constants `a`, **on the same probability space `M.Ω`
and driven by the same noises `M.ε`** as `M`.  The post-intervention coordinates
`X : M.Ω → Fin (p+1) → ℝ` therefore satisfy: `Xⱼ = aⱼ` for `j ∈ A`, and the
unchanged structural equation `Xⱼ = εⱼ + Σ_{k≠j} βⱼₖ Xₖ` for `j ∉ A` (same `β`,
same `ε`).

With this encoding, the target keeps its equation and noise law because `0 ∉ A`,
and non-descendants of `A` can be proved to keep their observational values.
Independence of `ε₀` from the post-intervention parent coordinates is not derived;
it is the separate `hExo` field below. -/

  /-- **Target exogeneity in this environment (the paper's Assumption 1).**  The
  target keeps its structural equation (`0 ∉ A`), so its noise `M.ε₀` is still
  independent of each *parent* coordinate `Xₖ` (`k ∈ PA(Y)`) — now of the
  post-intervention `X`.  As with `ObsSEM.hYexo` this is a consequence of recursive
  noise-independence + acyclicity that the random-variable encoding does not expose,
  so it is carried as a field; stated **only for parents** of the target. -/
