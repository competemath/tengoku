# Additive two-axis spans

For a generic index `R` equipped with two projections `f₁ : R → A` and
`f₂ : R → B`, the **additive span** is the linear subspace of `R → ℝ`
consisting of arrays of the form

    h r = a (f₁ r) + b (f₂ r)

for some `a : A → ℝ` and `b : B → ℝ`.  Specialized to `R = I × T`,
`f₁ = Prod.fst`, `f₂ = Prod.snd`, this is the classical two-way
fixed-effect subspace `H_twfe` used in `Causalean/Panel/FixedEffect.lean`
and across panel estimand-characterization arguments that residualize against
unit and time nuisance components.

The generic feature-map formulation lets panel and non-panel applications use
the same additive-subspace interface.

## Main definitions

* `AdditiveSpan f₁ f₂` — the additive-span subspace of `R → ℝ`.
* `twoAxisAdditiveSpan I T` — specialization to `R = I × T` with
  `f₁ = Prod.fst`, `f₂ = Prod.snd`.
* `IsUnitTimeAdditive` — membership predicate for the two-axis unit/time case.

## Main lemmas

* `AdditiveSpan.const_mem` — constants live in the additive span.
* `AdditiveSpan.finiteDimensional` — under `[Fintype R]` the span is
  finite-dimensional.

/-! # Additive Two-Axis Spans

This file defines `AdditiveSpan`, the linear subspace of finite arrays that
decompose additively through two index maps. It provides the generic algebra
behind two-way fixed-effect nuisance spaces, the product-index specialization
`twoAxisAdditiveSpan`, and the unit/time membership predicate
`IsUnitTimeAdditive`. The main public facts expose membership, constants in the
span, and finite dimensionality over a finite support. -/
