# Union bound for entrywise design-matrix concentration

The random design moment matrix has entries `M_{jk}(ω) = ∑ᵢ h_{jk}(ωᵢ)` with
`h_{jk}(a) = K((a−t)/h)·(a−t)^{j+k}` — each entry is an iid sum, so it concentrates around its
mean `N·𝔼[h_{jk}]` by `iid_sum_chebyshev`. To control the whole `(p+1)²`-entry matrix at once
(the "good event" on which the inverse perturbation bound applies) we union-bound over the
finite index set: the probability that *some* coordinate sum deviates from its mean by at least
`η` is at most the sum of the per-coordinate Chebyshev bounds.

This is the probabilistic half of the matrix-inverse concentration: combined with the
deterministic entrywise perturbation bound (`designInv00_perturb`), it shows that on an event of
probability `≥ 1 − ∑ Var/η²` the empirical moment matrix is invertible with controlled leverage.

/-- **Union bound for iid coordinate sums.** For a finite family `g : ι → Ω → ℝ` such that
[each `g a` is square-integrable under `μ`](hyp:hg), evaluated on an iid sample of size `N`
drawn from the product law `Measure.pi`, and for [any positive deviation threshold `η`](hyp:hη),
[the probability that *some* index `a` has its sample sum `∑ᵢ g a (ωᵢ)` deviate from its mean
`N·𝔼[g a]` by at least `η` is bounded by the sum of the per-index Chebyshev bounds
`N·Var[g a]/η²`](goal).

Specialising `ι` to the `(p+1)²` matrix-entry indices and `g` to the design statistics `h_{jk}`
controls every entry of the design moment matrix simultaneously on the complementary good event. -/
