/-- Given [a measure $\mu$ on an observation space](hyp:μ,Ω), [a sample of $n$
observations](hyp:w,n), and [a real-valued function](hyp:g), the [centered empirical
average](goal) is its sample average minus its integral with respect to $\mu$. For an empty sample the
average term is zero by the inverse-of-zero convention, so the value is minus the integral. -/

/-- Given [a measure $\mu$ on an observation space](hyp:μ,Ω) and [a family of
real-valued functions indexed by a set $\iota$](hyp:g,ι), the [countable empirical-supremum
reduction property](goal) holds exactly when [every member of the family is measurable](step:1)
and [there is a sequence of indices whose associated countable subfamily has, for every sample
size, the same supremum of absolute centered empirical averages as the full family almost surely
under the corresponding product measure](step:2). -/

/-- **Countable supremum reduction from pointwise density.** Let `μ` be a σ-finite measure on
`Ω`, `g : ι → Ω → ℝ` a family of functions, and `g0 : ℕ → ι` a countable subfamily. Suppose
[`S` is a `μ`-conull subset of `Ω`](hyp:hS), [on `S`, every `g i` is the pointwise limit, along
some subsequence, of the countable subfamily `g ∘ g0`](hyp:hdense), [each `g i` is
measurable](hyp:hmeas), and [there is a single `μ`-integrable envelope `G` dominating `|g i|`
uniformly in `i`](hyp:hdom). Then [the countable subfamily indexed by `g0` realizes the full
continuum empirical-process supremum of `g` almost surely under every finite product law of
`μ`](goal). -/
