# Countable-dense lifting for `sup` over uncountable separable index
  (thin re-export of `FoML.SeparableSpaceSup`)

Thin re-export of `FoML.SeparableSpaceSup`. Original lived under
`auto-res/lean-rademacher`, MIT License — see the FoML package
(`third_party/lean-rademacher/`) for full provenance and `LICENSE`.

The FoML symbols (`separableSpaceSup_eq`, `separableSpaceSup_eq_real`)
live in the root namespace; downstream code accesses them unqualified.

This file exposes countable-dense reductions for suprema over separable
function classes, letting empirical-process bounds stated on countable
subclasses apply to the full class of candidate estimators.
