# Quantiles of a continuous variation control

A continuous nondecreasing control on the unit interval has a monotone
section over its range. Dyadic points in that range therefore have consistent
representatives even when the control has flat intervals.

/-- If a continuous control path on the unit interval is
[nondecreasing](hyp:hmono) and [zero at time zero](hyp:hzero), then [every
level between zero and its terminal value is attained at some time, and these
representative times can be chosen increasing in the level](goal).

  /- The intermediate value theorem makes u surjective onto [0,u(1)].
  Choose one preimage for each level. Any choices at distinct levels are
  automatically ordered by monotonicity of u. A repeated dyadic level is
  literally the same argument of q, so plateaus cause no inconsistency. -/
