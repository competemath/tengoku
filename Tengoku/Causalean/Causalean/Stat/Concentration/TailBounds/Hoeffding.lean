# Hoeffding's inequality for i.i.d. samples

Causalean-facing corollaries of Mathlib's sub-Gaussian framework
(`Mathlib.Probability.Moments.SubGaussian`) specialized to the `IIDSample`
model.  We package:

* `IIDSample.map_eq` — each sample point has law `P`;
* `IIDSample.integral_comp_eq` — the population-mean identity
  `∫ f (Z i) ∂μ = ∫ f ∂P`;
* `iIndepFun_comp` — independence of `fun i ↦ f ∘ S.Z i`;
* `hoeffding_ge` / `hoeffding_abs_ge` — one-sided and two-sided Hoeffding tail
  bounds for the sample mean of a bounded statistic `f`.

The constants follow the standard scaling: an `[a,b]`-valued summand has
sub-Gaussian proxy `((b-a)/2)²` (Hoeffding's lemma), the `n`-fold sum has
proxy `n·((b-a)/2)²`, and rescaling by `1/n` yields the `2nε²/(b-a)²`
exponent.

/-! # Hoeffding inequalities

This file specializes Mathlib's sub-Gaussian tail machinery to the
`IIDSample` model. It records sample-point law and expectation identities
(`IIDSample.map_eq` from `Causalean.Stat.Sample`, `IIDSample.integral_comp_eq`),
independence of composed sample statistics (`IIDSample.iIndepFun_comp`), the
centered sample-mean/sum event identity `sampleMean_sub_ge_setEq`, and the
one- and two-sided sample-mean bounds `hoeffding_ge` and `hoeffding_abs_ge`.
