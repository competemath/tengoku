# Chebyshev bounds with a supplied variance envelope

This module provides a real-valued Chebyshev probability bound for one
square-integrable statistic whose mean is known and whose variance has a
supplied upper bound. This differs from `iid_sum_chebyshev`, which specializes
to an i.i.d. sum with its exact variance and states the result as an `ENNReal`
measure bound.

/-- For a finite measure `Q` and a statistic `F` on the underlying space, if [`F` is
square-integrable under `Q`](hyp:hF), [the deviation threshold `a` is positive](hyp:ha), [`F`
has mean equal to `mean` under `Q`](hyp:hmean), and [the variance of `F` under `Q` is at most
the envelope `v`](hyp:hvar), then [the probability that `F` deviates from `mean` by more than
`a` in absolute value is at most `v/a²`](goal). -/
