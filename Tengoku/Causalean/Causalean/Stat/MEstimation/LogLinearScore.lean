/-! # The log-linear (Poisson) score is locally but not globally Lipschitz

This module is the worked counterexample motivating the neighbourhood form of the Lipschitz
hypotheses in `Stat/EmpiricalProcess/Equicontinuity/` and `Stat/MEstimation/SmoothZEstimator.lean`.

For Poisson regression with a log link the observationwise score is
`ψ(θ, (x,y)) = (y - exp (θ x)) x`, with parameter derivative `-(exp (θ x) x²)`.  Two facts about
that derivative are proved here:

* on any ball around a target it is Lipschitz in the parameter, with the explicit envelope
  `|x|³ exp ((|θ₀| + δ) |x|)`, which is integrable under a standard exponential-moment condition
  on the regressor;
* there is **no** global Lipschitz envelope at all — already for the single observation with
  regressor and outcome one, the requirement is contradicted, because `exp` outgrows every
  linear function.

Together these say the neighbourhood hypothesis is satisfiable exactly where the global one is
not, so localizing it is what admits Poisson regression, exponential-mean GMM and nonlinear
least squares with an exponential link.

/-- For [an observation](hyp:z), [a target](hyp:θ₀), and [two parameters in the ball of radius
`δ` around it](hyp:θ,hθ,θ',hθ'), [the score derivative moves by at most the exponential-moment
envelope times the parameter distance](goal).

The envelope `|x|³ exp ((|θ₀| + δ) |x|)` depends on the radius, which is the point: it is finite
for each fixed `δ` and integrable under an exponential-moment condition on the regressor, whereas
no radius-free envelope exists — see `logLinearScoreDeriv_not_globally_lipschitz`. -/

/-- [No radius-free Lipschitz envelope exists for the log-link Poisson score
derivative](goal), already at the single observation whose regressor and outcome are one.

This is why the Lipschitz hypotheses in the equicontinuity and smooth Z-estimator developments
ask for a bound on a ball around the target rather than on the whole parameter space: for this
score the global requirement is not merely hard to verify, it is false. -/
