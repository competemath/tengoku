# Influence Functions (data layer)

Shared data structure packaging three regularity properties commonly imposed on
an influence function: measurability, mean-zero, and finite second moment. Mirrors
`def:sp-pathwise-diff` from `doc/basic_concepts/Semi-parametric Inference/
semi_parametric_inference.tex` at the *assumption* level: pathwise
differentiability and efficient-influence-function derivations are supplied by
the caller rather than derived in this data-layer structure.

Z-estimator, smooth Z-estimator, and GMM regularity packages construct this
predicate for their canonical influence functions; family-specific covariance
identities remain beside the corresponding estimator theory.

# Influence-function data layer

This module defines `InfluenceFunction`, the common data-layer predicate used
by estimator families to record measurability, mean zero, and an integrable
squared norm. It does not encode pathwise differentiability or efficiency.

/-- For [a sampling law](hyp:P) and [a candidate function](hyp:ψ), the
influence-function regularity predicate records that the candidate is
measurable, mean-zero, and square-integrable.

This is a data structure, not a derivation: the user supplies `ψ` and the
witnesses. Pathwise differentiability and the EIF characterisation are
deferred. -/
