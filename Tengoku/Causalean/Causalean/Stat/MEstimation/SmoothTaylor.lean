/-! # Taylor bounds from locally Lipschitz derivatives

This module provides the Banach-space Taylor remainder bound shared by smooth
Z-estimation and smooth GMM. It turns a derivative Lipschitz bound on a closed
ball into a quadratic first-order remainder bound between the ball's center
and any comparison point in the ball.

/-- For [a function between normed real vector spaces and its derivative
field](hyp:f,D),
[a center and comparison point](hyp:θ₀,θ), suppose [the derivative field is the
Fréchet derivative everywhere](hyp:hD), [its changes on a closed ball are
bounded by a nonnegative Lipschitz constant](hyp:hLnonneg,hLbound), and [the
comparison point lies in that ball](hyp:hθ). Then [the first-order Taylor
remainder between the center and comparison point is bounded by the Lipschitz
constant times their squared distance](goal). -/
