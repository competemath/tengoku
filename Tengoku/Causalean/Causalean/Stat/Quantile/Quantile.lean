# Quantile function (generalized inverse of a cdf)

Causal-agnostic statistical primitive: a lower generalized inverse of
Mathlib's `cdf` for a real measure. For probability measures this is the usual
left-continuous quantile function:

    quantile μ τ := sInf {x : ℝ | τ ≤ cdf μ x}.

Mathlib provides `ProbabilityTheory.cdf μ : StieltjesFunction ℝ` (monotone,
right-continuous, with limits 0 / 1) but has **no** generalized inverse; this
file supplies it together with the key order characterisation

    quantile μ τ ≤ x  ↔  τ ≤ cdf μ x       (for `0 < τ < 1`),

i.e. the Galois-style connection between the cdf and its inverse.  This is the
foundation for quantile treatment effects (`PO/ID/Exact/QTE/QuantileEffect.lean`)
and the quantile form of Lee trimming.

The interior restriction `0 < τ < 1` is intrinsic: for `τ ≤ 0` the defining set
is all of `ℝ` (so `sInf = 0` is meaningless) and for `τ ≥ 1` it can be empty in
the continuous, full-support case.  These are exactly the degenerate quantiles.
File is project-agnostic and a candidate for upstream contribution to Mathlib.

/-! # Quantile Function

This file defines the lower quantile function of a real measure as the
generalized inverse of its cumulative distribution function. It proves the
basic order characterization that connects cumulative distribution functions and
their quantiles away from the degenerate endpoints. -/

/-- Given a [measure on the real line](hyp:μ) and a [real level](hyp:τ), the
[super-level set of Mathlib's totalized cumulative-distribution function](goal)
contains the real points where that function is at least the level.

For an arbitrary measure this is a generalized-inverse construction for Mathlib's
totalized `cdf`; it has the usual measure-CDF interpretation under
`IsProbabilityMeasure μ`. -/
def quantileSet (τ : ℝ) : Set ℝ := {x : ℝ | τ ≤ cdf μ x}

/-- Given a [measure on the real line](hyp:μ) and a [real level](hyp:τ), the
[lower generalized inverse of Mathlib's totalized `cdf`](goal) is the infimum of
its super-level set at that level.

For an arbitrary measure this definition is totalized; it is the usual lower
measure quantile when `μ` is a probability measure. -/
