# Fréchet–Hoeffding bounds on the joint cdf

For a coupling `π ∈ Π(μ, ν)` with marginal cdfs `F = cdf μ`, `G = cdf ν`, the
**joint cdf** `H_π x y = π (Iic x ×ˢ Iic y)` obeys the pointwise
Fréchet–Hoeffding bounds

    `max (F x + G y - 1) 0 ≤ H_π x y ≤ min (F x) (G y)`.

The upper bound is `H ≤ F` and `H ≤ G` (monotonicity of measure under the two
projections onto the marginals); the lower bound is inclusion–exclusion on the
complement. Both bounds are *attained*:

* the comonotone coupling attains the **upper** bound `H = min (F, G)`;
* the countermonotone coupling attains the **lower** bound `H = max (F+G-1, 0)`.

This is the pointwise ordering that, integrated against the Hoeffding covariance
identity, yields the optimality of the monotone couplings.

/-- For a measure [on pairs of real-valued quantities](hyp:π) and
[real thresholds](hyp:x,y), the [joint cumulative distribution function](goal) is the
real-valued mass that the measure assigns to the lower-left quadrant consisting of pairs whose
first coordinate is at most the first threshold and whose second coordinate is at most the
second threshold. -/

/-- **Fréchet–Hoeffding upper bound.** For [a coupling `π` of the probability
measures `μ` and `ν`](hyp:h) and [reals `x` and `y`](hyp:x,y), [the joint cdf of
`π` at `(x, y)` is bounded above by the smaller of the marginal cdfs of `μ` at
`x` and `ν` at `y`](goal).

Proof: `Iic x ×ˢ Iic y ⊆ Iic x ×ˢ univ` and `⊆ univ ×ˢ Iic y`, whose masses are
`μ (Iic x)` and `ν (Iic y)` via the marginals. -/

/-- **Fréchet–Hoeffding lower bound.** For [a coupling `π` of the probability
measures `μ` and `ν`](hyp:h) and [reals `x` and `y`](hyp:x,y), [the joint cdf of
`π` at `(x, y)` is bounded below by the maximum of `0` and the sum of the
marginal cdfs of `μ` at `x` and `ν` at `y`, minus `1`](goal).

Proof: inclusion–exclusion on the complement of `Iic x ×ˢ Iic y`, using `π` a
probability measure and the two marginals. -/
