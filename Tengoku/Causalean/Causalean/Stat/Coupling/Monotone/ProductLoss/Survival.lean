# Survival functions of a coupling, and the survival-to-cdf bridge

For a coupling `π ∈ Π(μ, ν)` we record the two marginal *survival* functions and
the joint survival function

    `SX s = π{p | s < p.1}`,  `SY t = π{p | t < p.2}`,  `S s t = π{p | s < p.1 ∧ t < p.2}`.

Since `π` is a probability measure, complementation gives `SX = 1 - F` and
`SY = 1 - G`, and inclusion–exclusion on the two half-planes gives
`S = 1 - F - G + H_π`. The point of this file is the resulting **survival gap =
cdf gap** identity

    `S s t - SX s * SY t = H_π s t - F s * G t`,

which is what converts the Fubini computation of `Cov_π` (which naturally
produces survival functions, because the tail indicator `𝟙{s < x}` is a
*survival* indicator) into the Fréchet-gap form used by the optimality theorem.

This is pure algebra from `survFst_eq`, `survSnd_eq` and `jointSurv_eq`:
`(1 - F - G + H) - (1 - F)(1 - G) = H - F·G`. It is the reason the Fubini
computation, which produces survival functions, lands on the Fréchet gap. -/
