# Couplings and the explicit monotone couplings

A **coupling** of two real probability measures `μ, ν` is a probability measure
`π` on `ℝ × ℝ` whose two marginals are `μ` and `ν`. This file:

* uses the shared `IsCoupling π μ ν` predicate (probability measure with
  `π.map Prod.fst = μ`, `π.map Prod.snd = ν`), the Fréchet class `Π(μ,ν)`;
* defines the two extremal couplings built from the quantile transform:
  * `comonotoneCoupling μ ν` — pushforward of `Unif(0,1)` under
    `u ↦ (quantile μ u, quantile ν u)` (the *comonotone* / quantile coupling);
  * `countermonotoneCoupling μ ν` — pushforward under
    `u ↦ (quantile μ u, quantile ν (1 - u))` (the *countermonotone* coupling);
* proves each is genuinely a coupling of `(μ, ν)` (marginals via the PIT
  `quantile_map_uniform`, plus that `u ↦ 1 - u` preserves `Unif(0,1)`).

These are the optimizers whose optimality is established downstream.

/-- For [two measures on the real line](hyp:μ,ν), the [comonotone quantile
coupling](goal) is the image of the uniform measure on the open unit interval
under the pair of their quantile functions evaluated at the same uniform draw.
Both coordinates are therefore driven by that common draw.

For probability measures, this is the usual coupling associated with maximal
positive dependence among couplings having the specified marginals. -/

coupling](goal) is the image of the uniform measure on the open unit interval

coupling of `μ` and `ν` is indeed a coupling of the pair, i.e. its two marginals

Its marginals are computed by `Measure.map_map` composing with `Prod.fst`/
`Prod.snd`, which reduces each to `unifOI.map (quantile ·)`, equal to the
corresponding measure by the probability integral transform
`quantile_map_uniform`. -/
