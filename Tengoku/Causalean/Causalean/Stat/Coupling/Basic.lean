# Coupling predicate

This module defines the shared predicate for a probability measure whose two
marginals are prescribed. It is polymorphic in both measurable spaces so that
coupling constructions throughout the statistical library can use one common
interface.

/-- For [measurable spaces `α` and `β`](hyp:α,β), [a measure `π` on their
product and proposed marginal measures `μ` and `ν`](hyp:π,μ,ν), `π` is a
coupling of `μ` and `ν` when it is a probability measure and its first
and second marginals are respectively `μ` and `ν`. -/
