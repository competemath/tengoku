# Finite mixtures of measures

A finite mixture `mixture w P = ∑ i, w i • P i` of measures `P : ι → Measure Ω`
(over any finite index `ι`) with `ℝ≥0∞`-weights `w`.  When the weights sum to `1`
and each part is a probability measure, the mixture is a probability measure
(`mixture_isProbabilityMeasure`).  The key reusable fact for minimax lower bounds
is the **domination** lemma `mixtureReal_le`: a uniform `.real`-mass bound `B` on
every part transfers to the mixture.

/-! # Finite Mixtures of Measures

This file defines finite mixtures of measures with nonnegative extended-real
weights. It proves evaluation, probability-measure, and domination facts used to
transfer componentwise bounds to mixtures in minimax arguments. -/

/-! ## Continuous prior-predictive mixtures

This section complements finite weighted mixtures with mixtures obtained by integrating a
measurable experiment kernel against an arbitrary prior.  It records probability and integration
interfaces used by moment-matching and fuzzy-hypothesis lower bounds.
