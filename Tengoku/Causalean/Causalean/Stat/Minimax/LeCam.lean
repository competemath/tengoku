# Le Cam's two-point method

The reduction from estimation to hypothesis testing.  Given two probability
measures `P₀, P₁` on a sample space `Ω` whose parameter values `θ₀, θ₁` in a
(pseudo)metric space are `2s`-separated, **every** estimator `est : Ω → Θ` incurs

  `max ( P₀(dist(est, θ₀) ≥ s), P₁(dist(est, θ₁) ≥ s) ) ≥ ½ (1 − tvDist P₀ P₁)`.

This is the canonical minimax lower bound: it certifies that *no* estimator can
drive both error probabilities below `½(1 − tvDist)`.  The proof rests entirely
on the elementary testing bound `one_sub_tvDist_le_test` plus the triangle
inequality, with no measure-theoretic machinery beyond monotonicity.

The companion file `Causalean/Stat/Minimax/Pinsker.lean` supplies the bound on
`tvDist` in terms of Kullback–Leibler divergence that makes this usable for
concrete two-point families.

This file proves the two-point minimax lower bound that reduces estimation risk to
binary testing. It supplies the real-error and worst-case probability inequalities
used by later minimax-risk modules. -/
