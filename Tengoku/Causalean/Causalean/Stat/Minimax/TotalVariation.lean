# Total variation distance between probability measures

The statistical total variation distance

  `tvDist μ ν = ⨆ A measurable, |μ.real A − ν.real A|`

between two measures on a common space.  Mathlib only carries
`SignedMeasure.totalVariation` (the Jordan-decomposition norm); this file
develops the elementary *testing* characterization that drives Le Cam's
two-point method (`Causalean/Stat/Minimax/LeCam.lean`).

Main results (all under `[IsProbabilityMeasure μ] [IsProbabilityMeasure ν]`):

* `tvDist_nonneg`, `tvDist_le_one` — range `[0,1]`;
* `tvDist_symm` — symmetry;
* `measureReal_sub_le_tvDist` — each signed gap `ν.real A − μ.real A` is `≤ tvDist`;
* `one_sub_tvDist_le_test` — **the testing bound** `1 − tvDist μ ν ≤ μ.real A + ν.real Aᶜ`,
  i.e. the total error of any test (rejection region `A`) is at least `1 − tvDist`.

These are deliberately project-agnostic and are candidates for upstream
contribution to Mathlib.

/-! # Total Variation Distance

This file defines the statistical total variation distance between two probability
measures on a common measurable space. It develops elementary bounds and the
testing inequality that underlies Le Cam's two-point minimax method. -/
