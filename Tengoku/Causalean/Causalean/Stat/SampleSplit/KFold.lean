# K-fold sample split

Generalises `OneShotSplit` (in `OneShot.lean`) to K disjoint folds.  Used by
the cross-fitted DML estimator interfaces in
`Causalean/Estimation/OrthogonalMoments/DMLCrossFit.lean`.

Following Chernozhukov et al. (2018), at each sample size `n` the index
set `{0, …, n-1}` is partitioned into `K` folds `fold(n, k)` of roughly
equal size (`fold(n, k).card / n → 1/K`).  Fold k is the *evaluation* fold;
its complement `trainComplement(n, k) := {0,…,n-1} \ fold(n, k)` is used
to estimate the nuisance.

`folds_indep`: the evaluation fold `fold(n, k)` is independent of its
training complement under `μ`.

/-! # K-Fold Sample Splits

This file defines \(K\)-fold sample-splitting schedules for an i.i.d. sample,
including disjointness, coverage, fold growth, and limiting fold proportions.
It also proves that each evaluation fold is independent of its training
complement, supporting cross-fitted estimation procedures. -/
