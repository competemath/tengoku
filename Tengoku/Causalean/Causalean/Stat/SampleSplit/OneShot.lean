# One-shot sample split

`OneShotSplit` structure matching `def:est-one-shot-split` in
`doc/basic_concepts/po/estimation.tex`: a partition of the i.i.d. sample
into a nuisance fold `A(n) := {0, …, n₁(n)−1}` and an estimation fold
`B(n) := {n₁(n), …, n−1}` with both folds growing to infinity.

The headline lemma `folds_indep` (`prop:est-folds-indep`) states that the
two folds are independent under `μ`, expressed as `IndepFun` between the
fold-A and fold-B tuple-valued statistics — a direct corollary of
`iIndepFun.indepFun_finset` applied to the disjoint index sets.

/-! # One-Shot Sample Splits

This file defines a two-fold split of an i.i.d. sample into a nuisance-estimation
fold and a target-estimation fold, with both folds growing without bound. It
proves the finite-sample independence of the two fold-indexed sample tuples,
which is the basic splitting fact used in debiased estimation. -/
