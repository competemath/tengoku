# Gaussian characteristic-function bridge for the multivariate CLT

`Causalean/Stat/CLT/MultivariateCLT.lean`, `Stat/Inference/WaldVec.lean`, and
`Stat/Inference/RatioDeltaMethod.lean`
state their limit laws against an *abstract* target measure `Q` together with the
hypothesis
`charFun Q t = exp(−½ ∫⟪t,ψ⟫² dP)`  (`hQ`).
At the current Mathlib pin the multivariate-Gaussian characteristic-function
formula is available as
`ProbabilityTheory.IsGaussian.charFun_eq'`
(`Mathlib/Probability/Distributions/Gaussian/CharFun.lean`):
`charFun μ t = exp(⟪t, μ[id]⟫·I − covarianceBilin μ t t / 2)`.

This file provides the verified glue that converts a *concrete* centered Gaussian
`Q` whose covariance is identified with the influence-function second moment into
exactly the `hQ` shape those theorems consume. The concrete `Q` is now
constructed in `Causalean/Stat/CLT/GaussianLimit.lean` (`gaussianLimit`), as
`stdGaussian.map √Σ` with `Σ` the second-moment operator
(`Causalean/Stat/CLT/SecondMomentOperator.lean`) and `√Σ` its positive operator square
root (`Causalean/Mathlib/Analysis/InnerProductSpace/PosDef/Sqrt.lean`);
de-abstraction is complete.

/-! # Gaussian Characteristic-Function Bridge

This file connects concrete centered Gaussian measures with the characteristic
function form used by the library's multivariate central-limit theorems. It
identifies the Gaussian covariance with the second moment of an influence
function so that abstract limit-law hypotheses can be discharged.

`charFun_isGaussian_centered` specializes the Mathlib Gaussian characteristic
function formula to centered Gaussian measures. `charFun_isGaussian_of_cov_eq`
then rewrites the covariance form into the influence-function integral
`∫ ⟪t, ψ x⟫² ∂P`, matching the abstract target used by the multivariate CLT
theorems. -/
