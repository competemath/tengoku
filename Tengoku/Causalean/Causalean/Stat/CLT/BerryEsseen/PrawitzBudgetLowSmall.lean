/-! # Low-frequency Prawitz allocation at small moment ratios

This assembly lemma connects the spectral kernel and discrepancy envelope to
the independently proved polynomial Gaussian moment bound. The complementary
ratio interval is handled separately; the full budget retains all ratios.

/-- For [a positive moment ratio ρ at most one hundredth](hyp:ρ,hρ,hsmall), with
the logarithmic inner cutoff U0 = max(3/2, √(4 log(1/ρ))) and the reciprocal
outer cutoff U = 12/(5ρ), [the low-frequency Prawitz contribution
(2/U)·∫ over [0, U0] of the Prawitz filter magnitude times the discrepancy
envelope is at most one quarter of ρ](goal).

    (ρ : ℝ) (hρ : 0 < ρ) (hsmall : ρ ≤ 1 / 100) :
    let U0 := max (3 / 2 : ℝ) (Real.sqrt (4 * Real.log (1 / ρ)))

  /- All imported analytic leaves are closed. Establish rho*U0 <= 1/5:
  log(1/rho) <= 1/rho-1 and rho <= 1/100 give
  rho^2 * 4*log(1/rho) <= 4*rho*(1-rho) <= 1/25.
  Handle the max's 3/2 branch separately. For 0<t<=U0, use the
  kernel norm bound and U0<=U to obtain
    (2/U)*norm(K(t/U)) <= 1/(pi*t)+5*rho/12.
  The first member of the discrepancy min is at most
    (rho*t^3/6+rho^2*t^4/8)*exp(-23*t^2/100)
  since rho*t<=1/5. Multiplication cancels the apparent 1/t
  singularity and gives exactly the polynomial in
  prawitz_low_gaussian_moment_budget.

  Prove measurability and interval integrability using domination by that
  nonsingular polynomial Gaussian (the assigned kernel value at t=0 is
  harmless). Move 2/U inside the interval integral, rewrite as an Ioc set
  integral, compare, and extend the nonnegative majorant to Ioi 0. Reuse
  the Gaussian moment leaf without redoing its Gamma calculation. This
  module must not import either full or complementary budget theorem. -/
