/-! # High-frequency Prawitz allocation at small moment ratios

This assembly lemma splits at the reciprocal-ratio cutoff and applies the
two independently proved weighted Gaussian tails. The complementary ratio
interval and the unchanged full high-frequency budget are separate modules.

/-- For [a positive moment ratio ρ at most one hundredth](hyp:ρ,hρ,hsmall), with
the logarithmic inner cutoff U0 = max(3/2, √(4 log(1/ρ))) and the reciprocal
outer cutoff U = 12/(5ρ), [the high-frequency Prawitz contribution
(2/U)·∫ over [U0, U] of the Prawitz filter magnitude times the moment
envelope is at most three twentieths of ρ](goal). -/
theorem prawitz_budget_high_small
    (ρ : ℝ) (hρ : 0 < ρ) (hsmall : ρ ≤ 1 / 100) :
    let U0 := max (3 / 2 : ℝ) (Real.sqrt (4 * Real.log (1 / ρ)))
    let U := 12 / (5 * ρ)
    (2 / U) * (∫ t in U0..U,
      ‖prawitzKernel (t / U)‖ * prawitzMomentEnvelope ρ t) ≤ 3 * ρ / 20 := by
  /- All imported analytic leaves are closed. Prove U0<=A<=U for
  A=1/(2*rho), using the same log bound as the low small case. On the
  middle interval rho*t<=1/2 implies damping <=exp(-2*t^2/5).
  On the far interval t<=U implies damping <=exp(-t^2/50).
  The scaled kernel bound in both cases is 1/(pi*t)+5*rho/12.
  Integrability here follows from measurability and continuous majorants
  away from zero. Split the interval integral at A.

  Bound the middle integral by gaussian_reciprocal_linear_tail_bound
  at a=U0, b=2/5, c=5*rho/12, using nonnegative integral restriction.
  Since U0^2>=4*log(1/rho), its exponential is <=rho*sqrt(rho)
  (weaken the exponent -8log(1/rho)/5 to -3log(1/rho)/2).
  Combine U0>=3/2, sqrt(rho)<=1/10, pi>3 to obtain a middle
  allocation <=rho/20. The independently proved far bound is <=rho/20.
  These bounds leave slack inside the required 3*rho/20 allocation.
  Prove every tail/interval integrability premise before comparison. This
  module must not import either full or complementary high budget theorem. -/
