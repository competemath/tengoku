/-! # Finite rational certificates for the moving Prawitz cutoffs

This is a finite arithmetic obligation, independent of either integral
budget. The low table certifies exp(B²/4) ≥ 1/r using a lower Taylor
polynomial. The high table certifies C ≤ 3/2 or exp(C²/4) ≤ 1/s using
the proved eighth-power exponential enclosure. Thus B bounds the actual
inner cutoff from above, and the rescaled high index bounds it from below
on the WHOLE parameter cell [r,s]. No sampled log/sqrt value is a premise.

  /- Lowest open layer: only finite rational arithmetic. Use interval_cases
  on j.val (retaining j.isLt), unfold the explicit arrays/getD and the
  degree-16 series, and close with kernel-checked norm_num/decide proofs.
  Split into helper certificates by index blocks if proof reduction is
  expensive; do not use native_decide, unsafe elaboration, or new axioms.
  All 270 cases were independently evaluated with Python Fraction as a
  scaffold sanity check, including every displayed inequality. That check
  is NOT a Lean proof and supplies no hypothesis here.

  Later analytic adapters: positive r,s and the Taylor lower comparison
  give 1/r <= exp(B²/4), hence sqrt(4*log(1/r)) <= B. For the high index,
  C<=3/2 is already below U0(s); otherwise the upper comparison yields
  exp(C²/4)<=1/s and C<=sqrt(4*log(1/s)). Multiply by 5*r/12 and use the
  proved monotonic cutoff lemma to cover all rho in [r,s]. The original
  low/high integrals and constants are unchanged. -/
