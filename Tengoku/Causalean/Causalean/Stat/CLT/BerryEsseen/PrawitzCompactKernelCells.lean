/-! # Polynomial cell enclosures for the Prawitz filter

These deterministic bounds remove cotangent from frequency-cell certificates.
The reflected upper-band and Jordan lower-band estimates are extracted from
PrawitzBudgetHighCompact without changing their statements or proofs. The
quartic lower-band cell enclosure is the remaining analytic leaf; it uses
only the endpoints of a cell, and retains the full positive half-band.

  Positivity follows from b≤1/2 and π<4, so no additional cell-size condition

  component by division, bound the real component by (1-a)/2, and compare
  their squares using Complex.sq_norm and Complex.normSq_apply. The existing
  Jordan estimate below can guide component algebra; it is too loose to
  certify the high-frequency allocation. Do not assume a numerical integral
  budget, and do not add imports of any compact-budget headline. -/
