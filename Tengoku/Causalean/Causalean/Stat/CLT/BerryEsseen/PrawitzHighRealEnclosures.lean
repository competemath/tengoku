/-! # Analytic adapters for the rational high-frequency cells

The lower-half Taylor kernel and upper-half reflected polynomial use the
actual real pi here. The first adapter compares their squared enclosures
with the rational pi interval; the second compares the rescaled cubic
exponential with the reciprocal Taylor entry. These are pointwise scalar
inequalities, not integral allocations. They import no open budget or real
cutoff adapter. At the outer kernel endpoint the later integral comparison
must still be made only almost everywhere, as in PrawitzRescaledCells.

  /- Round 8 lowest analytic kernel layer. Let p=314159/100000 and
  q=314160/100000; use the CLOSED rational pi bounds. If i<500,
  0<a<=b<=1/2. Compare 1-(pi*a)²/2+(pi*b)^4/24 with
  1-(p*a)²/2+(q*b)^4/24, and pi*a*(1-(pi*b)²/6) with
  p*a*(1-(q*b)²/6)>0. The denominator factor is positive since
  q<4 and b<=1/2. Establish numerator nonnegativity before division
  and squaring (the proved cosine quartic estimate at pi*a supplies
  it, since b>=a and cos(pi*a)>=0). Use 1/pi<=1/p. In the upper
  branch only pi²<=q² and (1-a)^4>=0 are needed. After push_cast,
  the result is exactly prawitzRationalKernelSq. This is NOT a bound
  on the assigned kernel value at u=1, which remains excluded a.e. -/

  gives s>0, and hi gives 0<=a<=b<=1. For z in [0,1],
  72*z²/25-1728*z³/625 = (72/625)*z²*(25-24*z)>=0.
  Thus e>=0; after casting, e=-E (min/max and division by s²>0).
  Apply prawitz_exp_neg_le_reciprocal_taylor16. This preserves the
  cubic damping rather than the rejected exp(-t²/50) majorant.
  Later assembly combines this and the kernel square adapter with
  the CLOSED square certificate to bound each existing rescaled
  cell integral by prawitzRationalHighCell, then outward rounds it. -/
