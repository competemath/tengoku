/-! # Far-frequency Gaussian allocation for small Prawitz ratios

This bounded real integral handles the far part of the high-frequency budget
using the coarse global damping bound. The reciprocal weight is nonsingular
throughout this interval. The full high-frequency budget remains a separate
theorem over all ratios strictly between zero and one.

/-- For [a positive ratio ρ at most one hundredth](hyp:ρ,hρ,hsmall),
[the integral from the reciprocal-ratio cutoff 1/(2ρ) to the fixed outer
cutoff 12/(5ρ) of (1/(πt) + 5ρ/12)·exp(−t²/50) is at most one twentieth of
ρ](goal). -/

  /- Prove interval integrability by continuity (t stays positive). Bound
  1/(πt)+5ρ/12 by (2/π+5/12)*ρ and the exponential by
  exp(-1/(200ρ²)). The interval length is 19/(10ρ). For q>0,
  exp(q)≥q³/6 gives exp(-q)≤6/q³. At q=1/(200ρ²), the resulting
  bound is (19/10)*(2/π+5/12)*48000000*ρ⁶. After dividing by ρ,
  ρ⁵≤(1/100)⁵ and π>3 certify the stated rational allocation.
  No floating-point quadrature is needed for this helper.

  Connection to PrawitzBudgetHigh: on t≤U=12/(5ρ), the cubic exponent
  -t²/2+ρt³/5 is at most -t²/50. Combine this leaf with
  GaussianWeightedTail for the middle subinterval when ρ≤1/100.
  The complementary ρ>1/100 case still needs its own compact-parameter
  certificate with the actual kernel/envelope. Do not replace the full
  high-budget statement by this helper case. -/
