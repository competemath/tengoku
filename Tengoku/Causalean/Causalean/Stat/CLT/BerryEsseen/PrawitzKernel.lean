/-! # Prawitz's compact spectral smoothing filter

These explicit functions separate the analytic prerequisites of sharp CDF
smoothing from probability laws. Frequencies are in radians. The singular
value at zero is assigned zero; all later integrals are Lebesgue integrals,
so this endpoint convention has no effect on their value.

Reference: Tyurin, arXiv:0912.0726, equation (praineq) and its displayed
filter. The fetched LaTeX source is in `tmp/mnar_round3_sources/arxiv.tex`.
