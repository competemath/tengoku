# The second-moment (covariance) operator of a vector-valued influence function

For an influence function `ψ : X → E` valued in a finite-dimensional real
inner-product space with `‖ψ‖²` integrable under `P`, the **second-moment
operator**

    Σ t = ∫ ⟪t, ψ x⟫ • ψ x ∂P

is the self-adjoint positive operator whose quadratic form recovers the
asymptotic-covariance integral

    ⟪Σ t, s⟫ = ∫ ⟪t, ψ x⟫ ⟪s, ψ x⟫ ∂P.

This is the operator `Σ` whose square root (`LinearMap.IsPositive.posSqrt`,
`Causalean/Mathlib/Analysis/InnerProductSpace/PosDef/Sqrt.lean`) builds the
limiting Gaussian in the multivariate CLT. Centering (`∫ ψ = 0`) is *not*
assumed here; `Σ` is the raw second moment. In the CLT application `ψ` is
already centred, so `Σ` is the covariance.

Key declarations:
* `secondMomentLM` — the operator as a `LinearMap`.
* `secondMomentLM_inner` — the quadratic-form identity.
* `secondMomentLM_isPositive` — `Σ` is a positive operator.

/-! # Second-Moment Operator

This file constructs the second-moment operator associated with a vector-valued
influence function. The operator supplies the covariance object whose positive square
root is used in vector central limit theorems.

The helper theorem `integrable_inner_smul` proves integrability of the operator
integrand. The main API is `secondMomentLM`, the bilinear-form identity
`secondMomentLM_inner`, and `secondMomentLM_isPositive`, which supplies the
positivity needed to take the operator square root used by the concrete Gaussian
limit. -/
