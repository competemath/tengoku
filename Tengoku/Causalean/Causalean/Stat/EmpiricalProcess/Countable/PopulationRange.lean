# Bounded population versions from set-integral tests

A measurable real version need not be bounded at every point. Testing its
integral on every measurable set against fixed lower and upper constants
forces an almost-everywhere range bound and integrability on finite measures.
No integrability of the tested version is assumed. This bridge allows
threshold measurability to use conditional-version primitives without
strengthening them to pointwise positivity or boundedness on null sets.

/-- Under [a finite measure μ](hyp:μ), if [a real function f](hyp:f) is
[measurable](hyp:hf), [two constants satisfy l ≤ u](hyp:l,u,hlu), and [on
every measurable set the integral of f lies between l and u times the
set's mass](hyp:htest), then [f lies between l and u almost everywhere and
is integrable](goal).

No integrability of f is assumed.
