# Countable one-sided skeletons inside arbitrary real subsets

A deterministic eligibility set need not be open or have a continuous loss.
Choose a countable dense subset of that set and adjoin its points isolated on
the required side. Those boundary representatives are countable by Mathlib's
countable_setOfPred_isolated_left_within/right_within. Approximation stays
inside eligibility, even at a closed localization boundary.

/-- [The one-sided boundary](goal) of [a set T of eligible
cutoffs](hyp:T), on [the side selected by a Boolean flag](hyp:upper), is
[the set of points of T that are isolated from the points of T strictly
above them (flag true) or strictly below them (flag false)](step:1).

Such cutoffs cannot be approximated from that side and must be included as
representatives.
