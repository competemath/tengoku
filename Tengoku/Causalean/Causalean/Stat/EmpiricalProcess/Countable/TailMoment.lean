# Fourth-moment tail integration

Layer cake and Tonelli convert a weak tail bound into the mixed fourth-moment
estimate used by Doob. Tail integrals use positive real levels and include
the event boundary; Layercake already justifies the closed-tail convention.
This file has no martingale or empirical-process dependencies.
