# Population mass of a countable nested union

Localization on every member of a countable nested chain passes to its
containing union without loss in the population mass budget. This is the
bridge needed before using an energy bound on that union. The empty chain
is included by requiring the budget to be nonnegative.

/-- Let [a countable family of sets](hyp:B) be [measurable](hyp:hB) and
[nested, any two members being comparable by inclusion](hyp:hchain), and let
[a weight g](hyp:g) be [integrable under μ](hyp:μ,hg) and
[nonnegative](hyp:hpos). If [a nonnegative budget L](hyp:L,hL) [bounds the
integral of g over every member](hyp:hbudget), then [the union of the
family is measurable and the integral of g over the union is at most
L](goal).

The empty family is covered because the budget is nonnegative.
