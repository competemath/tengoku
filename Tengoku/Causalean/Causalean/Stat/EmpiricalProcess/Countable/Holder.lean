# Mixed fourth moments

The fourth-power Holder inequality and finite-maximum moment legality are
independent of martingales. They are the lowest analytic layer for Doob's
inequality; neither assumes a maximal-moment estimate.

/-- Under [any measure μ](hyp:μ), if [two real functions f and
g](hyp:f,g) are [nonnegative](hyp:hf,hg), [almost everywhere strongly
measurable](hyp:hfm,hgm), and [have integrable squares](hyp:hf2,hg2), then
[their product is integrable and the square of its integral is at most the
product of the integrals of their squares](goal).

This Cauchy–Schwarz form uses ordinary squares, so it needs no
finite-measure assumption.
