# GMM asymptotic-variance algebra and the optimal-weighting theorem

Pure operator-algebra core of the Generalized Method of Moments (Hansen 1982).
No measure theory: everything here is finite-dimensional linear algebra on
continuous linear maps between real inner-product spaces.

Fix a Jacobian `G : E →L[ℝ] F` (the derivative of the population moment
`θ ↦ ∫ g(θ) dP` at the truth; `E` is the parameter space, `F` the moment space,
`dim E ≤ dim F`), a symmetric positive-definite weighting operator `W : F →L F`,
and the moment covariance `Cov : F →L F` (symmetric, positive).  The GMM
estimator with weighting `W` has **sandwich asymptotic variance**

    V(W) = (GᵀWG)⁻¹ GᵀW Σ WG (GᵀWG)⁻¹            (`gmmSandwich`)

while the **efficient** choice `W = Σ⁻¹` gives

    V★ = (GᵀΣ⁻¹G)⁻¹.                              (`effInv`)

(`Cov` stands for the covariance `Σ`, which is a reserved token in Lean.)

The headline `gmm_efficiency` proves the covariance lower-bound implication
behind Hansen (1982), Theorem 3.2: `V(W) − V★` is a positive operator. It
does not formalize that theorem's characterization of all optimal limiting
weighting matrices.

The proof is the classical one.  With

    A := (GᵀWG)⁻¹ GᵀW,        B := (GᵀΣ⁻¹G)⁻¹ GᵀΣ⁻¹,

one has `AG = BG = id` (the inverse witnesses), and the cross terms collapse,
`AΣBᵀ = BΣAᵀ = BΣBᵀ = V★`, because `Σ` and `Σ⁻¹` cancel against the bread.
Hence

    (A − B) Σ (A − B)ᵀ = V(W) − V★,

and the left side is positive by `IsPositive.conj_adjoint` applied to `Σ ⪰ 0`.

Inverses are carried as *data with two-sided witnesses* (mirroring
`ZEstimatorRegularity.J₀_inv`/`J₀_inverse`) so no operator inverse needs to be
constructed; invertibility of `GᵀWG`/`Σ`/`GᵀΣ⁻¹G` is supplied by the caller.
The covariance comparison itself uses only the right-inverse witness for the
efficient bread; its left-inverse witness is retained for interface symmetry.

/-! # GMM Variance Algebra

This file proves the finite-dimensional operator algebra behind GMM asymptotic
variance.  It defines the GMM bread operator `gmmBread` and the sandwich
variance operator `gmmSandwich`, using supplied two-sided inverse witnesses
rather than constructing operator inverses.

The headline theorem `gmm_efficiency` is the covariance lower-bound component
of Hansen's optimal-weighting result: for a symmetric weighting `W`, positive
covariance `Cov`, and inverse covariance `CovInv`, the sandwich variance
`gmmSandwich G W Cov breadInv` dominates the efficient variance `effInv`.
The helper `adjoint_inv_self` records self-adjointness of a right inverse of a
self-adjoint operator and is used to collapse the cross terms in the proof. -/

[a two-sided inverse `CovInv`](hyp:hCovinvL,hCovinvR), suppose further that

[the accompanying left-inverse witness is accepted but not needed for this comparison](hyp:_heL).
Then [the sandwich variance minus the efficient variance is positive semidefinite](goal).

Concretely: `gmmSandwich G W Cov breadInv − effInv` is positive,
i.e. `V(W) ⪰ V★ = (GᵀCovInvG)⁻¹`. -/
