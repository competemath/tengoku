# I.i.d. sample model

Causal-agnostic statistical primitive: an i.i.d. sample on a single ambient
measured space, matching Mathlib's `iIndepFun` / `IdentDistrib` idiom rather than
the product-space construction. Probability normalization is supplied separately
when applications require it. See `def:est-iid-sample` in
`doc/basic_concepts/po/estimation.tex`.

This file is intentionally project-agnostic and is a candidate for upstream
contribution to Mathlib.

/-! # I.i.d. Samples

This file provides the library's causal-agnostic model of an independent and
identically distributed sample relative to arbitrary ambient and population
measures; probability-measure instances are supplied separately when needed. It
also defines sample means of real-valued statistics along the first \(n\) sample
points, supplying the base object used by the limit and inference modules. -/

/-- An independent and identically distributed sample with marginal law `P`, realized as
[a sequence of sample points](hyp:Z) given by [measurable maps](hyp:meas) on a single
ambient measured space: [the family is mutually independent](hyp:indep), [identically
distributed](hyp:identDist), and [the law of each point is the measure `P`](hyp:law).
Neither the ambient measure nor `P` is required by this structure to be a probability measure.

* `Z i : Ω → X`             — the `i`-th sample point.
* `meas`                    — measurability of each `Z i`.
* `indep`                   — mutual independence of the family under `μ`.
* `identDist`               — every `Z i` is identically distributed with `Z 0`.
* `law`                     — the law of `Z 0` matches the population law `P`.

Together, `identDist` and `law` give `μ.map (Z i) = P` for all `i`. -/

/-- Each individual sample point of an i.i.d. sample is a measurable map from the ambient
measured space to the observation space.

This is the `meas` field with the sample index instantiated. The field itself is stated for
all indices at once, which the function-property tactics cannot use; this per-index form is
the one they can.
