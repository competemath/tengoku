# IID sample → product measure transport (`Fin n` version)

The Phase E2 discharge of `localized_uniform_deviation` to `Ω`-events
needs the joint pushforward identity

    μ.map (fun ω : Ω => fun k : Fin n => S.Z k ω)
        = Measure.pi (fun _ : Fin n => P_W).

This file provides that identity (`iidSample_finN_pushforward`) plus the
event-transport corollary (`event_pullback_along_iidSample`) which
converts a high-probability event in `Set (Fin n → X)` (the natural
output of `localized_uniform_deviation`) into an Ω-event of equal mass
under the IID sample.

Pattern mirrors `FoldBEmpiricalProcess.oneShot_iid` (lines 301–314).

/-! # Transport to Product Samples

This file proves that the joint observable of a finite independent identically
distributed sample pushes the underlying probability measure forward to the
corresponding finite product measure. It also transports high-probability events
on product samples back to events on the original sample space.

Two further transports live here.  First, forgetting part of an i.i.d. sample:
restricting a product sample to a sub-index (a cross-fitting fold, a sample
split, a `Finset` of coordinates) is measure preserving onto the product measure
over the sub-index, so integrals and pushforwards transport verbatim.  Second,
the *existence* of an i.i.d. sample with a prescribed marginal, which is shown
to be equivalent to that marginal being a probability measure — i.e. to carry no
information at all. -/

/-! ## Restricting a product sample to a sub-index

A sample split, a cross-fitting fold, and "the observations whose index lies in
`S`" are all the same operation: keep the coordinates satisfying a decidable
predicate and forget the rest.  Because the coordinates are independent, the
kept ones again have the product law over the sub-index. -/

marginal being a probability measure.

In other words, assuming "the data are an i.i.d. draw from `P`" as an *existential* over ambient
probability spaces adds nothing to the assumption that `P` is a probability law: the infinite
product space always supplies such a sample. Any substantive sampling content has to come from
fixing the sample, not from asserting that one exists. -/
