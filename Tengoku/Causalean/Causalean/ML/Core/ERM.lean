/-! # Empirical-risk-minimizer predicates

Minimizer predicates for the ML spine, stated **candidate-wise** via Mathlib's
`IsMinOn` (or a comparison `+ ε` form), never via `sInf`/`argmin` — this avoids
pathological real-infimum defaults on empty or unbounded sets, matching the
existing `Estimation.OrthogonalLearning.PluginERM` idiom.

The file provides exact, approximate, and regularized parametric ERM predicates
(`IsERMP`, `IsApproxERMP`, `RegularizedERM`), plus extensional empirical and
population minimizer predicates (`IsERM`, `IsPopulationRiskMinimizer`) over a
`HypothesisClass`.  The parametric and extensional views are connected in
`Causalean.ML.Core.Bridge`.

/-- `θhat` exactly minimizes a parametric objective over the admissible set. -/
structure IsERMP {Θ : Type*} (objective : Θ → ℝ) (Θset : Set Θ) (θhat : Θ) : Prop where
  /-- The minimizer is admissible. -/
  mem : θhat ∈ Θset
  /-- It attains the minimum of the objective over `Θset`. -/
  isMin : IsMinOn objective Θset θhat

/-- `θhat` minimizes a parametric objective up to slack `ε ≥ 0`. -/
structure IsApproxERMP {Θ : Type*} (objective : Θ → ℝ) (Θset : Set Θ)
    (θhat : Θ) (ε : ℝ) : Prop where
  /-- The slack is nonnegative. -/
  ε_nonneg : 0 ≤ ε
  /-- The candidate is admissible. -/
  mem : θhat ∈ Θset
  /-- Its objective is within `ε` of every competitor's. -/
  approx_min : ∀ θ ∈ Θset, objective θhat ≤ objective θ + ε

/-- `θhat` minimizes a penalized objective `objective θ + lam · penalty θ` with a
nonnegative regularization weight `lam`. -/
structure RegularizedERM {Θ : Type*} (objective : Θ → ℝ) (penalty : Θ → ℝ)
    (lam : ℝ) (Θset : Set Θ) (θhat : Θ) : Prop where
  /-- The regularization weight is nonnegative. -/
  lam_nonneg : 0 ≤ lam
  /-- The minimizer is admissible. -/
  mem : θhat ∈ Θset
  /-- It minimizes the penalized objective over `Θset`. -/
  isMin : IsMinOn (fun θ => objective θ + lam * penalty θ) Θset θhat

/-- An empirical-risk minimizer is an admissible prediction rule whose
finite-sample risk criterion is no larger than that of any other admissible
rule.  The criterion is the inverse-cardinality-scaled loss sum over a nonempty
finite sample. -/

    (H : HypothesisClass X Y) (loss : Loss Y) (S : ι → X × Y) (hhat : X → Y) : Prop where
  /-- The minimizer belongs to the class. -/
  mem : hhat ∈ H.carrier
  /-- It minimizes empirical risk over the class. -/
  isMin : IsMinOn (fun h => empiricalRisk loss S h) H.carrier hhat

/-- A population-risk minimizer bundles the claim that a prediction rule [belongs to the
hypothesis class](hyp:mem), that [it has finite expected loss under the population
measure](hyp:finite_self), that [every other rule admissible in the class also has finite expected
loss](hyp:finite_competitor), and that [its population risk is no larger than that of any other
rule in the class](hyp:isMin).

The integrability fields for the minimizer and every competitor ensure that comparisons of
population risk correspond to comparisons of genuine (finite) Bochner integrals. -/
