# Induced Subgraph of a SWIG Graph

Defines `SWIGGraph.induce`, the graph-level restriction to an observed
subset `R`. The induced graph is itself a `SWIGGraph`, exploiting the
weakened `dag_edges_classified` invariant.

## Main definitions

* `SWIGGraph.induce G R` — restrict `G.observed` to `R ∩ observed`,
  drop any `fixed` node whose `iotaMap` image no longer lies in the
  restricted observed set, keep exactly the latent roots that point into the
  restricted observed set, and filter edges to those with both endpoints in the
  new active set.

This is a library construction; the current Basic Concepts graphical-definitions
note does not state an induced-SWIG-subgraph definition.

/-! # Induced SWIG Subgraphs

This file defines graph-level restriction of a Single World Intervention Graph
to an observed subset. The construction keeps the relevant observed nodes,
retains only fixed nodes whose random counterparts remain observed, retains only
latent roots that feed those observed nodes, and filters edges to the resulting
active vertex set.

The auxiliary `inducedEdge` and `inducedDag` restrict the ambient DAG. The
ambient DAG's derived topological order supplies an acyclicity witness for the
restriction; the restricted DAG derives its own order. The main constructor
`SWIGGraph.induce` builds the restricted SWIG and proves all structural
invariants; `inducedDag_edge_iff` and the parent/child subset lemmas expose the
relationship with the ambient graph. The theorem `induce_isAncestor_mem_R`
shows that every nontrivial descendant in an induced subgraph lies in the
retained observed part of `R`. -/

-- ============================================================
-- The induce operation
-- ============================================================

/-- For [a single-world intervention graph](hyp:G) and [a retained set of split nodes](hyp:R), the [induced single-world intervention graph](goal) has as its [observed nodes the retained observed nodes](step:1), fixed nodes precisely those original fixed nodes whose random counterparts remain observed, unobserved nodes precisely those original unobserved nodes with an edge into the retained observed nodes, and directed edges precisely the original edges with both endpoints among these retained nodes.

    **Induce a sub-SWIG on a subset `R`.** The new `observed` is
    `R ∩ observed`; the new `fixed` drops any fixed node whose
    `iotaMap` image was removed; the new `unobserved` keeps exactly the
    original latent roots with an edge into the retained observed set; the DAG
    keeps only edges with both endpoints in the new active set.

    This operation lands back in `SWIGGraph` because the new
    `dag_edges_classified` invariant is preserved under edge removal. -/
