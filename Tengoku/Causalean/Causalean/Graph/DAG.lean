/-! # Directed Acyclic Graphs

This file provides finite directed acyclic graphs. A `DAG` is represented by a
decidable edge relation together with the standard acyclicity condition: no
vertex reaches itself along a directed path (`∀ v, ¬ Relation.TransGen edge v v`).
This is the textbook definition, and it is the entire data of the structure — a
`DAG` is determined by its edge relation.

A topological numbering is **not** part of the definition; it is *derived*. The
strict ancestors of a vertex are computed by a finite backward-reachability
fixpoint (`ancClosure`), which yields both a decidable ancestor relation
(`decIsAncestor`, order-free and computable) and a canonical strict-ancestor count
(`ancestorRank`, computable). The topological order
`topoOrder v = rank v * |V| + enum v` is built on the rank; it satisfies
injectivity (`topoOrder_injective`) and edge-consistency (`topoOrder_lt`), so
downstream constructions that need a topological order use it exactly as before.
`topoOrder` is `noncomputable` because the tie-breaking enumeration of a bare
finite type needs a choice of ordering; it is used purely for its ordering
properties, never reduced on concrete values (decidable ancestry goes through
`ancClosure`).

This file also defines immediate neighborhoods (`parents`, `children`), strict
reachability (`isAncestor`, `isDescendant`), finite ancestor/descendant sets,
set-level ancestry operations (`ancestralSet`, `descendantsSet`), non-descendants,
and roots.

/-- A Directed Acyclic Graph on a finite vertex type: [a decidable edge
relation](hyp:edge,decEdge) together with the condition that [no vertex is connected to itself by
a directed path](hyp:acyclic) — the transitive closure of the edge relation is irreflexive.
Irreflexivity of the transitive closure is exactly the statement that the graph
has no directed cycle.

The acyclicity condition is the whole content of the structure, so a DAG is
determined by its edge relation. A topological order is not stored; it is derived
(see `DAG.topoOrder`). -/

/-- **Acyclicity from a topological ranking.** Given an edge relation `e` on `V` and a ranking
function `τ` into a type equipped with a transitive, irreflexive relation `r`, if [`τ` strictly
increases (with respect to `r`) along every edge of `e`](hyp:hτ), then [`e` has no directed
cycle: no vertex is reachable from itself via the transitive closure of `e`](goal).

A cycle `v ⇝ v` would force the strictly increasing `τ` to satisfy `r (τ v) (τ v)`,
contradicting irreflexivity of `r`. This is the standard way to discharge the `acyclic` field
when building a `DAG` from a construction that already carries a topological numbering
in hand (concrete examples, SWIG parity orders, a parent graph's order).

The numbering appears only inside this (proof-level) lemma, so a `DAG` whose
`acyclic` field is `DAG.acyclic_of_topoOrder hτ` stays computable even when the
witnessing `τ` is `noncomputable` — the witness certifies acyclicity but is erased,
and the resulting DAG's own `topoOrder` is the choice-dependent derived numbering,
not `τ`.
