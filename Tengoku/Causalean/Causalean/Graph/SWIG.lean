# SWIG Graph: Node Type, Graph Construction, and Split Operation

This file defines the SWIG (Single World Intervention Graph) graph structure
following Richardson and Robins.

## Main definitions

* `SWIGNode` — node type: each original node has a `random` and `fixed` version
* `swigΩ` — value-space family: both versions share the same value space
* `swigEdge` — the edge relation in a SWIG DAG
* `swigDAG` — the SWIG as a `DAG (SWIGNode N)` given an original `DAG N` and targets
* `iotaMap` — the injection mapping fixed → random counterpart
* `SWIGGraph` — graph-level causal packaging:
  `(S, V, U, E, ι)` with root constraints

The library's multi-target split operation (`SWIGGraph.splitMono`) is in the
sibling file `Graph/SWIGSplitMono.lean`.

## Design note

This file provides the pure graph-level SWIG construction. The probabilistic
side lives in `SCM` (see `Causalean/SCM/Model/SCM.lean`).

The `SCM` structure extends `SWIGGraph N`, so every structural causal model
already lives in the SWIG node space. A standard model (no interventions) has
`fixed = ∅`; non-listed fixed-form nodes are isolated dummies outside
`unobserved`, whose members are random-form latent nodes.

/-! # Single World Intervention Graphs

This file defines the graph-theoretic structure of a Single World Intervention
Graph (SWIG). A base variable `n : N` has two SWIG nodes: `.random n`, used for
the natural random variable, and `.fixed n`, used for intervention values. The
shared value-space family `swigΩ` gives both copies the same measurable value
space as the base variable.

The core construction is `swigDAG G targets`. It keeps incoming edges into
targeted random nodes, reroutes outgoing edges from each targeted random node to
the corresponding fixed node, and leaves fixed nodes for non-targets isolated.
The interleaved order `swigTopo` proves that this edge relation is acyclic, and
the basic lemmas describe roots, target parents, and the initial no-intervention
SWIG.

The structure `SWIGGraph` packages a DAG on SWIG nodes together with the fixed,
observed, and unobserved node sets, the link map `ι` from fixed nodes to their
random counterparts, and root/classification invariants used by structural
causal models. The namespace also provides graph equivalence up to edge and
partition equality, plus parent/child classification lemmas. The monolithic
multi-target split operation is defined in `Causalean.Graph.SWIGSplitMono`. -/

-- SWIG Node Type
-- ============================================================

/-- For [a collection of base variables](hyp:N), the [population of nodes in a single-world intervention graph](goal) consists of [a random-node constructor that assigns each base variable its natural random copy](hyp:random) and [a fixed-node constructor that assigns each base variable its intervention copy](hyp:fixed). Thus it is the disjoint union of two copies of the base-variable population.

    Each original node n has a random version `random n` and a fixed version
    `fixed n`. In a SWIG with intervention targets T:
    - `random n` exists for all n (the natural/random version)
    - `fixed d` is meaningful only for d ∈ T (the intervention value)
    - For d ∉ T, `fixed d` is an isolated dummy node

    In the SWIG split, a targeted variable keeps its random copy for incoming edges while
    its fixed copy carries the outgoing edges. -/

/-- For [a finite directed acyclic graph](hyp:G) and [a set of intervention targets](hyp:targets), the [single-world-intervention edge relation](goal) declares [that a random copy points to a random copy precisely when the corresponding original edge starts outside the targets](step:1), [that a fixed copy points to a random copy precisely when its base variable is targeted and has the corresponding original outgoing edge](step:2), and [that every other ordered pair has no edge](step:3).

    The edge relation in a SWIG.

    Given an original DAG G and intervention targets T:
    - (random u → random v): edge iff G.edge u v AND u ∉ T
      (if u is a target, its outgoing edges go from fixed u instead)
    - (fixed d → random v): edge iff d ∈ T AND G.edge d v
      (fixed d inherits the outgoing edges of d)
    - All other pairs: no edge (fixed nodes have no parents in the SWIG)

    Equivalently, the SWIG edge set is obtained by replacing each outgoing edge from a
    target `d` with an edge from `.fixed d`, while retaining incoming edges to `.random d`. -/
def swigEdge (G : DAG N) (targets : Finset N) : SWIGNode N → SWIGNode N → Prop

/-- For [a finite collection of base variables with decidable equality](hyp:N), [a directed acyclic graph on those variables](hyp:G), and [a finite set of intervention targets](hyp:targets), the [decision procedure for the single-world-intervention edge relation](goal) determines, for every ordered pair of split nodes, whether the pair is joined by a SWIG edge. -/

-- SWIG Topological Order

/-- For [a finite directed acyclic graph](hyp:G), the [interleaved topological order of its split nodes](goal) assigns [each random copy one plus twice its base variable's topological position](step:1) and [each fixed copy twice that position](step:2).

    Topological order for the SWIG.

    We double the original topological order and interleave:
    - fixed n  ↦ 2 * topoOrder n
    - random n ↦ 2 * topoOrder n + 1

    This ensures fixed d has smaller order than random v whenever G.edge d v
    (since topoOrder d < topoOrder v in the original DAG). -/

/-- For [a finite directed acyclic graph](hyp:G) and [a set of intervention targets](hyp:targets), the [single-world intervention graph as a directed acyclic graph](goal) is obtained by replacing every outgoing edge of a targeted variable by an edge from its fixed copy while retaining all incoming edges to its random copy.

    The SWIG DAG: the DAG on SWIGNode N constructed by node-splitting.

    Given an original DAG G and intervention targets T ⊆ V, the SWIG G(T) has:
    - For each target D ∈ T: random D keeps incoming edges, fixed D gets outgoing edges
    - For non-targets: random n keeps all original edges
    - Fixed nodes for non-targets are isolated (no edges) -/

/-- A Single-World Intervention Graph (SWIG), `G = (S, V, U, E, ι)` (the definition labelled
    `def:swig-graph` in Basic Concepts.tex): [a directed acyclic graph on the SWIG nodes](hyp:dag)
    equipped with [fixed intervention nodes](hyp:fixed), [observed random nodes](hyp:observed),
    and [unobserved random nodes](hyp:unobserved), where [every fixed node is genuinely of fixed
    form](hyp:fixed_is_fixed), [every observed node is of random form](hyp:observed_is_random),
    [every unobserved node is of random form](hyp:unobserved_is_random), and [the observed and
    unobserved sets are disjoint](hyp:obs_unobs_disjoint). [Every edge of the graph has both
    endpoints classified as fixed, observed, or unobserved](hyp:dag_edges_classified); [the map
    sending each fixed intervention node to its random counterpart lands inside the observed
    nodes](hyp:fixed_image_in_observed); [fixed nodes](hyp:fixed_are_roots) and [unobserved

    The three pairwise-disjoint classification sets cover every endpoint of an
    edge, but need not cover all carrier points: isolated random-form points may

    mapping `ι : S → V` and root constraints on S and U.
