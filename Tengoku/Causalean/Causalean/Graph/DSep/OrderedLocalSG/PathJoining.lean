/-! # Joining active walks in the ordered-local peel

This file develops the walk-composition tools for the ordered-local induction. It
joins active walks across non-collider seams, relates forward directed walks to
ancestry, preserves activity under prefix extraction, and proves the survive-or-splice
alternative used when a maximal conditioning vertex is removed.

/-- In [a finite directed acyclic graph](hyp:V,G), consider [a conditioning set,
joining vertex, endpoints, and two walks](hyp:Z,m,x,y,pa,pb). If [the first walk is active
from the first endpoint to the join](hyp:hpa_len,hpa_head,hpa_last,hpa_act), [the second
is active from the join to the second endpoint](hyp:hpb_len,hpb_head,hpb_last,hpb_act),
[its first edge points out of the join](hyp:hseam_out), and [the joining vertex is not
conditioned on](hyp:hmZ), then [concatenating the walks gives an active walk between the
endpoints](goal). -/
