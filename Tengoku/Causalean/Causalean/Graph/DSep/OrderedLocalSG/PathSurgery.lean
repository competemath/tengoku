/-! # Walk surgery for the ordered-local peel

This file proves the d-separation and active-walk transformations used when the
ordered-local induction removes a topologically maximal vertex. The results cover
parent inheritance, erasing a maximal random conditioning vertex, changing a walk's
conditioning set, orienting its final edge, and joining walks at a conditioned collider.

/-- In [a finite directed acyclic graph](hyp:V,G), consider [a source vertex, target
set, conditioning set, and selected parent set](hyp:n,Y,D,A0). If [the source is
d-separated from the target](hyp:hdSep), [every selected vertex is a parent of the
source](hyp:hA0_par), and [none is conditioned on](hyp:hA0_D), then [the selected parents
are d-separated from the target under the same conditioning set](goal).

    Graphically: an active `a → … → Y` walk can be prepended with the edge
    `a → n` (giving `n, a, …, Y`); the new interior vertex `a` is a non-collider
    there (`a → n`, not `n → a`), and `a ∉ D`, so the extended walk is active from
    `n` to `Y`, contradicting `dSep {n} Y D`. -/

/-- For [a finite directed acyclic graph, two endpoint sets, random and fixed conditioning sets,
and a selected vertex](hyp:V,G,X,Y,Zr,Zf,n), if [the vertex belongs to the random conditioning
set](hyp:hnZr), [it is topologically maximal in the ancestral closure of the query](hyp:hmax),
and [the endpoint sets are d-separated by the full conditioning set](hyp:hdSep), then [erasing
that vertex from the random conditioning set preserves the d-separation](goal).

**A maximal random conditioning node can be dropped.** If `n ∈ Zr` is the
    topological maximum of the query's ancestral set, then deleting it from the
    conditioning set preserves d-separation of `X` and `Y`.

    Graphically: since `n` is topologically maximal among all ancestors of
    `X ∪ Y ∪ Zr ∪ Zf`, no proper descendant of `n` lies in that ancestral set, so
    on every active `X → Y` walk the node `n` (if present) can only be a collider,
    and that collider is activated solely by `n` itself. Removing `n` from the
    conditioning set therefore closes every active walk through `n` and creates none. -/
