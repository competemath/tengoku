/-! # Bayes Ball Reachability

This file implements the Bayes Ball reachability computation for finite directed
acyclic graphs. Given source and conditioning sets, it tracks directed arrival
states and returns the vertices reachable along walks that remain active under
the conditioning information.

The core definitions are `BBDir`, `BBState`, `bbZAncestors`, one-step transition
`bbStep`, initial frontier `bbInit`, reachable state set `bbReachable`, and
vertex projection `bbReachableVertices`. The exposed invariants include source
monotonicity (`bbReachable_mono_source`,
`bbReachableVertices_mono_source`), minimality of the fixed point, and closure of
reachable states under `bbStep`. -/

/-- For [a finite directed acyclic graph on a vertex population](hyp:V,G),
[a conditioning set](hyp:Z), and [a current Bayes Ball state](hyp:s), [writing the state as
its vertex and arrival direction](step:1),
    the [one-step successor set](goal) sends an arrival from a child at an unconditioned vertex to
    its parents and children, and sends such an arrival at a conditioned vertex nowhere; it sends
    an arrival from a parent at an unconditioned vertex to its children and, when that vertex is an
    ancestor of a conditioned vertex, also to its parents, while an arrival from a parent at a
    conditioned vertex goes to its parents.

    Rules (encoding collider/non-collider blocking):
    - fromChild, w ∉ Z: go to parents (fromChild) and children (fromParent)
    - fromChild, w ∈ Z: stop (conditioned non-collider blocks the path)

/-- Iterative Bayes Ball with a step budget. Given [a conditioning set](hyp:Z), [the current
frontier of ball states](hyp:frontier), [the states visited so far](hyp:visited), and [a budget of
expansion rounds](hyp:fuel), [the fuel-bounded reachable set](goal) is obtained by returning the
visited states when the budget is exhausted, and otherwise expanding the frontier by one Bayes Ball
step, stopping with the visited states if no new state appears and recursing on the new
states with one
less round otherwise. It is the reachable set only when the budget suffices
for the traversal to close, as arranged by `bbReachable`. -/
