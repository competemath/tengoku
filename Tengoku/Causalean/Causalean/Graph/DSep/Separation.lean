This file defines d-separation in a finite directed acyclic graph as pairwise
disjointness of the query sets together with absence of Bayes Ball reachability
from the source set to the target set given a conditioning set. It proves
structural properties used by the global Markov and identification layers:
monotonicity in source and target sets, the union rule for collider-activation
ancestors (`bbZAncestors_union_eq`), directed-path extraction avoiding a
conditioning set, source-to-conditioning transfer (`dSep_source_to_cond`),
transfer to edge subgraphs (`dSep_of_edge_subgraph`), and symmetry. -/

exactly when [the source and target sets are disjoint](step:1), [the source and conditioning

[no target vertex is Bayes-Ball reachable from the source set after conditioning on the

    The query sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be pairwise disjoint, and every
    Bayes-Ball active walk from `X` to `Y` must be blocked by `Z`. -/

/-- In [a finite directed acyclic graph](hyp:V,G), consider [source and conditioning
sets, a walk, and its endpoints](hyp:X,Z,S,p,x,w). If [the first endpoint belongs to the
source set](hyp:hxX), [the walk is nontrivial](hyp:hlen), [is active under the enlarged
conditioning set](hyp:hact), and [has the stated endpoints](hyp:hhead,hlast), then [there
is an active walk under the original conditioning set whose source may also come from the
newly conditioned vertices](goal).

    Given an active walk `p` from `x ∈ X` to `w` given `Z ∪ S`, there exists
    an active walk `p'` from some `x' ∈ X ∪ S` to `w` given `Z`.

    **Proof sketch.**

    Let `q` be the suffix of `p` starting at the *last* vertex of `p` that
    lies in `S`; if no vertex of `p` lies in `S`, take `q := p`. Then
    * `head q ∈ X ∪ S` (either the original `x ∈ X`, or an `S`-vertex);
    * the interior of `q` contains no vertex of `S`.

    Classify each interior vertex `m` of `q`:
    * **Non-collider on `q`.** From `p`-activity, `m ∉ Z ∪ S`, hence `m ∉ Z`. ✓
    * **Collider on `q`.** By `bbZAncestors_union_eq`,
      `m ∈ bbZAncestors Z ∨ m ∈ bbZAncestors S`.
      * If `m ∈ bbZAncestors Z`, the collider is already `Z`-activated.
      * Else `m ∈ bbZAncestors S \ bbZAncestors Z`. Since `m` is interior of `q`
        we have `m ∉ S`, so `m` is a proper ancestor of some `s ∈ S`. Pick the
        last such "`S`-only activated" collider `m*` on `q`. Along any directed
        path `m* → v₁ → … → s ∈ S` no interior vertex lies in `Z` (otherwise
        `m* ∈ bbZAncestors Z`), and the terminal `s ∉ Z` for the same reason.

        **Reroute.** Replace the prefix `[head q, …, m*]` of `q` by the reversed
        directed path `[s, v_{k−1}, …, v₁, m*]`. The new path:
        * has head `s ∈ S ⊆ X ∪ S`; tail still `w`;
        * interior of the new prefix: directed, so each `vᵢ` is a non-collider;
          each `vᵢ ∉ Z` by choice of the directed path.
        * `m*` at the join becomes a non-collider (one incoming edge from the
          `q`-side, one outgoing edge `m* → v₁`), and `m* ∉ Z` since `m*` was a
          collider on the originally active `q` (so `m* ∉ Z ∪ S`).
        * interior after `m*` is unchanged; any collider there lies in
          `bbZAncestors Z` by choice of `m*` as the *last* `S`-only one.

    Formalized by a 4-way index case split (`r.reverse` interior, the two seam
    triples at the `m*` join, and `qTail` interior), using asymmetry of `G.edge`
    for the reversed-directed portion and maximality of `j_star` on the `qTail`
    side. -/

/-- **Source-to-conditioning transfer for d-separation.** If [`X` and `S` are
    disjoint](hyp:hXS) and [`X ∪ S` and `Y` are d-separated by `Z`](hyp:h), then [`X` and `Y`
    remain d-separated once `S` is moved into the conditioning set:
    `G.dSep X Y (Z ∪ S)`](goal). Equivalently: `bbReachableVertices (Z ∪ S) X`
    is a subset of `bbReachableVertices Z (X ∪ S)`.

    **Intuition.** Conditioning on `S` (LHS) opens collider paths through
    ancestors-of-`S` but also blocks non-collider paths through `S`. Having
    `S` available as a source (RHS) reproduces the collider-opening effect via
    a directed detour to an `S`-descendant, while blocked non-colliders
    through `S` don't arise because the suffix we keep has no `S`-interior.

    Reduces to `activeWalk_transfer_cond_to_source` via the BFS↔active-walk
    equivalence. -/

/-- **d-separation transfers from a supergraph to a subgraph.** For DAGs `G` and `G'` on the
    same vertex set, if [every edge of `G'` is also an edge of `G`](hyp:hEdge) — `G'` is
    obtained from `G` by removing edges — and [`X` and `Y` are d-separated by `Z` in
    `G`](hyp:h), then [`X` and `Y` are also d-separated by `Z` in `G'`](goal).

    **Direction.** Fewer edges can only destroy active walks, never create new
    ones, so `G'`-BFS-reachability is a subset of `G`-BFS-reachability.

    **Usage in backdoor / Rule 3.** The split SWIG graph `G(x,z)` is a subgraph
    of `G(x)` (outgoing edges of `.random D` for `D ∈ Z` are removed). A
    d-sep hypothesis in `G(x)` therefore implies the same d-sep in `G(x,z)`.

    **Proof.** Shows `G'.bbZAncestors Z ⊆ G.bbZAncestors Z`
    (monotonicity of `ancestorsSet` in the edge relation, i.e. fewer edges give
    fewer ancestors) and then lifts via `bbReachableVertices_iff_activeWalk`:
    any `G'`-active walk is `G`-active since each `G'`-adjacency is a
    `G`-adjacency and collider activation only grows (collider activation
    requires ancestor witnesses, which are weaker in `G'`). -/

    an active walk from `X` to `Y`, contradicting `dSep X Y Z`. -/
