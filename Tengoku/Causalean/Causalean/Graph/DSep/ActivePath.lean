# Active Walks

This file defines active walks in DAGs and proves walk surgery lemmas
needed for the source-to-conditioning transfer in d-separation.

## Main definitions

* `DAG.UAdj` — undirected adjacency
* `DAG.IsCollider` — collider at a triple
* `DAG.IsActiveWalk` — active (unblocked) walk given a conditioning set
* `DAG.HasActiveWalk` — existence of an active walk between two vertex sets

## Main results

* `DAG.isActiveWalk_reverse` — reversing an active walk gives an active walk
* `DAG.hasActiveWalk_symm` — active-walk existence is symmetric
* `DAG.bbReachableVertices_iff_activeWalk` — BFS ↔ active-walk equivalence

## References

* Basic Concepts.tex, “Blocked path” and `def:dsep` (the notes use simple paths;
  the internal witnesses here are walks)

/-! # Active Walks

This file defines active walks in directed acyclic graphs relative to a
conditioning set. Unlike the textbook simple paths in Basic Concepts.tex, these
finite vertex sequences may repeat vertices. It records undirected adjacency
(`UAdj`), collider triples (`IsCollider`), walk activity (`IsActiveWalk`), and
active-walk existence between sets (`HasActiveWalk`).

The main walk lemmas prove reversal symmetry (`isActiveWalk_reverse`,
`hasActiveWalk_symm`), directed-walk activity helpers, suffix extraction for
source-to-conditioning transfer, and the Bayes Ball correctness theorem
`bbReachableVertices_iff_activeWalk`, which identifies computed reachability
with existence of an active walk. -/

one direction or the other](step:1), and [at every consecutive triple, its middle vertex is
a collider that is either conditioned on or has a conditioned descendant, or else is a
non-collider outside the conditioning set](step:2).

    A walk (list of vertices, with repetitions permitted) is **active**
    (unblocked) given conditioning set `Z` if:
    - consecutive vertices are undirected-adjacent
    - for every intermediate triple `(pᵢ, pᵢ₊₁, pᵢ₊₂)`:
      - if `pᵢ₊₁` is a collider: `pᵢ₊₁ ∈ G.bbZAncestors Z`
      - if `pᵢ₊₁` is not a collider: `pᵢ₊₁ ∉ Z`

    Defined index-wise to make reversal straightforward. -/

at least two vertices](step:1)
    that is [active relative to the conditioning set](step:2), whose [first vertex belongs to the
    source set](step:3), and whose [last vertex belongs to the target set](step:4).

    Repeated vertices are permitted. The length-at-least-two convention records
    only nontrivial reachability, which is the case used for pairwise-disjoint

    The proof uses the index-based definition: index `i` in the reversed list
    corresponds to index `p.length - 1 - i` in the original list. Adjacency
    is symmetric (`UAdj_symm`) and collider status swaps the outer vertices
    (`And.comm`). -/

/-- A Bayes-Ball direction matches the orientation of the last edge of a walk:
`fromParent` means the previous vertex is a parent of the current one, while

/-- **Bayes Ball correctness.** For [a source vertex set `X` and a conditioning vertex set
`Z`](hyp:X,Z) and [a vertex `v`](hyp:v), [`v` lies in the breadth-first-search reachable set
`bbReachableVertices Z X` if and only if there is an active walk, given `Z`, from some vertex
of `X` to `v` containing at least two vertices](goal).

    This is the Bayes Ball correctness theorem. The proof requires showing that
    the BFS fixed point captures exactly the vertices reachable via active walks.

    Forward direction (soundness): every BFS-reachable vertex has an active walk.
    Backward direction (completeness): every vertex with an active walk is BFS-reachable. -/
