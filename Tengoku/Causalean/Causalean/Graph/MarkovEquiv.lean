# Markov equivalence of DAGs (Verma–Pearl) — umbrella

Entry point for the formalization of the **Verma–Pearl characterization of Markov
equivalence** (Verma & Pearl, *Equivalence and synthesis of causal models*, 1990): two
directed acyclic graphs declare the same conditional-independence constraints exactly when
they have the same skeleton and the same v-structures. Import this file for the whole
development; the headline result is stated here so it is not buried among the supporting
files.

## Main results

* `MarkovEquiv` (`Defs.lean`) — two DAGs declare the same d-separations.
* `markovEquiv_iff_sameSkeleton_sameImmoralities` (this file) — **the flagship.** Two DAGs
  are Markov equivalent iff they have the same skeleton (`SameSkeleton`, undirected
  adjacency) and the same v-structures (`SameImmoralities`, colliders with non-adjacent
  parents). The constraint-based characterization underlying PC/FCI/GES and the CPDAG.
* `DAG.dSep_iff_moralSep` (`Moralization.lean`) — the Lauritzen moralization
  criterion: d-separation in a DAG is equivalent to graph separation in the
  moral graph of the ancestral closure.

## Supporting machinery

`Readoff.lean` (easy direction — skeleton and v-structures are read off the d-separation
relation), `Transfer.lean` (hard direction — same skeleton + v-structures transfer every
d-separation), and `Moralization.lean` (the ancestral moral graph criterion for
d-separation). The development reuses the existing d-separation engine
(`Causalean.Graph.DSep`).

The higher-layer companion `Causalean.SCM.Do.MarkovEquivDistributional` connects
this graph notion to distributions and proves `SCM.distMarkovEquiv_of_markovEquiv`;
it is not imported or re-exported by this Graph umbrella.

/-- **Verma–Pearl (1990).** For [two DAGs `G₁`, `G₂` on the same vertex set](hyp:G₁,G₂),
[they are Markov equivalent — they declare exactly the same d-separations, hence impose the
same conditional-independence constraints — if and only if they have the same skeleton and
the same v-structures (immoralities)](goal).

The easy direction reads the skeleton and v-structures from d-separation. The hard
direction is supplied by the covered-edge reversal route: same-skeleton/same-immorality
DAGs are connected by covered edge reversals, each preserving every d-separation. -/
