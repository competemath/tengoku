# Nonancestor marginal invariance for finite DAG product densities

This module turns reverse-topological density elimination into equality of measures.  Replacing
one normalized conditional density by a normalized parent-independent density preserves the
marginal on every parent-closed set omitting the target, hence on the ancestral closure of every
distinct node of which the target is not an ancestor.  Measurable functions determined by that
closure consequently have identical pushforward laws.

# Finiteness of a normalized finite-DAG density law

This section records the measure-theoretic finiteness consequence of pointwise normalization of
all local factors. It supplies the `IsFiniteMeasure` instance required by Mathlib's
`CondIndepFun` API without making conditional independence part of the factorization interface.
