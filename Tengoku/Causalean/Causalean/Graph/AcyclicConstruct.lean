/-! # Constructing a DAG from a raw acyclic edge relation

Since `DAG` stores acyclicity directly (`acyclic : ∀ v, ¬ Relation.TransGen edge v v`),
building one only requires exhibiting the edge relation, its decidability, and a
proof that it has no directed cycle. This file provides:

* `DAG.ofAcyclic e hac` — from an edge relation `e` whose transitive closure is
  irreflexive (`hac`). Materialises the graph directly. (Used e.g. for the
  Verma–Pearl covered-edge reversal, where acyclicity of the modified relation is
  known before any topological numbering.)

For constructions that already carry a topological numbering, build the `DAG`
structure directly and discharge its `acyclic` field with
`DAG.acyclic_of_topoOrder` (in `Causalean.Graph.DAG`), which keeps the edge
relation definitionally transparent.
