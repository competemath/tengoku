/-! # Markov equivalence of DAGs — basic definitions

This file introduces the combinatorial vocabulary for the Verma–Pearl characterization of
Markov equivalence. Two directed acyclic graphs on the same vertices are **Markov
equivalent** when they encode exactly the same d-separation statements, i.e. the same
conditional-independence constraints. The Verma–Pearl theorem (proved in the umbrella
file) says this happens precisely when the graphs share a *skeleton* and the same
*v-structures* (immoralities).

The definitions here are:

* `DAG.IsImmorality G a b c` — there is a v-structure (immorality) `a → b ← c` whose two
  parents `a, c` are non-adjacent and distinct;
* `SameSkeleton G₁ G₂` — the two graphs have the same undirected adjacency;
* `SameImmoralities G₁ G₂` — the two graphs have the same v-structures;
* `MarkovEquiv G₁ G₂` — the two graphs declare the same d-separations.

The first three relations have decidable instances on a finite vertex type. `MarkovEquiv` is
instead the semantic relation quantified over all finite vertex sets. The underlying undirected
adjacency is the existing `DAG.UAdj` (`a` and `b` joined by an edge in either direction), and a
collider `a → b ← c` is `DAG.IsCollider`.

/-- For [a finite directed acyclic graph on a vertex population](hyp:V,G) and
[three ordered vertices](hyp:a,b,c), [the v-structure, or immorality, condition](goal) holds
exactly when the first and third vertices are distinct, each has a directed edge into the
second, and no directed edge joins the first and third in either direction.

Immoralities are the colliders whose parents are non-adjacent; they are exactly the part of the
collider structure that is visible to conditional independence. -/

first graph if and only if they are d-separated in the second graph.

Equivalently, via the global Markov property, the two graphs impose the same
conditional-independence constraints on every distribution. Pairwise disjointness is already
part of d-separation, so it need not be repeated here. -/
