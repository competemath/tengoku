/-! # Covered-edge reversal

This barrel collects the covered-edge route used in the hard direction of the Verma–Pearl
characterization. `FlipEdge` constructs the reversal and proves that it preserves the skeleton
and immoralities. `ActivePathTransport` and `PathSurgery` develop the active-walk transport
machinery. `MarkovEquivalence` proves that one covered-edge reversal preserves every
d-separation statement. `Causalean.Graph.MarkovEquiv.Decompose` assembles these single-edge
steps into the full hard direction.
