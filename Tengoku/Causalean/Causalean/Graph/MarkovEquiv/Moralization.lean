/-! # Markov equivalence — the moralization criterion

This file develops the **moral graph** of a DAG and the classical *moralization criterion*
for d-separation. It proves that, for pairwise-disjoint source, target, and conditioning
sets, d-separation is equivalent to separation in the moral graph of the ancestral set.

* `DAG.MoralAdj G S u v` — `u` and `v` are adjacent in the moral graph restricted to a
  ground set `S`: they are skeleton-adjacent (`UAdj`) or "married", i.e. they have a common
  child inside `S`.
* `DAG.MoralConn G S Z u v` — `u` reaches `v` by a moral path inside `S` all of whose
  vertices avoid `Z`.
* `DAG.MoralSep G X Y Z` — no `x ∈ X` is moral-connected to any `y ∈ Y` inside the
  ancestral set `An(X ∪ Y ∪ Z)` while avoiding `Z`.
* `DAG.dSep_iff_moralSep` — **the criterion**: for pairwise-disjoint sets, d-separation is
  exactly moral separation in the ancestral set.

The file also proves that moral adjacency, moral steps, and moral connectivity are
invariants of a graph's skeleton together with its v-structures, for a fixed ground set.
The main Verma–Pearl hard direction used by the public umbrella theorem is assembled through
the covered-edge route in `Transfer.lean` and `Decompose.lean`.

-- Direction 1: an active walk induces a moral path (active ⇒ moral)
-- ============================================================

/-- An active walk inside a ground set, with endpoints outside the conditioning set,
induces a connection in the corresponding moral graph.

If `p` is an active walk given `Z`
of length ≥ 2, all of whose nodes lie in the ground set `S`, and both endpoints avoid
`Z`, then the head and last of `p` are moral-connected inside `S` avoiding `Z`.

The moral path threads the *non-collider* vertices of `p`: consecutive non-colliders are
skeleton-adjacent, and across a collider apex `b` (skipped) the two flanking parents are
married through `b ∈ S`. The proof is strong induction on `p.length`, peeling one vertex
(skeleton step) or two vertices (across a collider) from the front. -/
