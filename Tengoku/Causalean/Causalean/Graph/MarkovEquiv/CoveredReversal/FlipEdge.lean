/-! # Constructing a covered-edge reversal

This file defines covered edges and constructs `DAG.flipEdge` by reversing one of them. It proves
that the flipped relation is acyclic and that the resulting DAG has the same skeleton and
immoralities as the original graph. Active-walk transport across this construction is developed
in `ActivePathTransport` and `PathSurgery`; the resulting Markov-equivalence theorem is in
`MarkovEquivalence`.

/-- For [a finite directed acyclic graph on a vertex population](hyp:V,G) and
[two vertices](hyp:a,b), [the covered-edge condition](goal) holds exactly when there is a
directed edge from the first vertex to the second and, for every other vertex, that vertex has
an edge into the first if and only if it has an edge into the second.

Then the parent set of the first vertex equals the parent set of the second after removal of the
first vertex. Covered edges are exactly the reversible (unprotected) ones. -/
