/-! # Active-walk surgery for covered-edge reversal

This file proves that the list operations from `ActivePathTransport` preserve active walks under
the required splice conditions. It also shows that `swapPath` preserves endpoints and yields an
active walk when no obstructing triple occurs. `MarkovEquivalence` uses these results to remove
obstructions and transport an arbitrary active walk across a covered-edge reversal.

/-- For [a finite directed acyclic graph, the endpoints of a directed edge, a conditioning set,
and a walk](hyp:V,G,a,b,Z,p), if [the directed edge is covered](hyp:hcov), [the original walk is
active](hyp:hact), and [none of its consecutive interior triples obstructs the reversal](hyp:hfork),
then [replacing the affected collider occurrences yields an active walk after the covered-edge
reversal](goal).

When no interior triple of `p` is flip-obstructing, `swapPath` is `flipEdge`-active. The
swap repairs exactly the collider-`a` positions whose activation is lost; genuine
fork-traversals of the covered edge are kept and stay active because `a` (resp. `b`) remains a
non-collider after the flip. This generalises the no-traversal case: a walk with no `a — b`
adjacency at all trivially has no flip-obstructing triple. -/
