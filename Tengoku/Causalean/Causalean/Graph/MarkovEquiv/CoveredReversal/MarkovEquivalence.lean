/-! # Markov equivalence under one covered-edge reversal

This file assembles the active-walk transport machinery into `markovEquiv_flipEdge`. Obstructing
triples are removed by strictly shortening the walk, while unobstructed walks are handled by
`swapPath`. Applying the argument in both directions shows that reversing one covered edge
preserves every d-separation statement. The finite-chain decomposition that uses this result is
in `Causalean.Graph.MarkovEquiv.Decompose`.

/-- **Reduction step.** If some interior triple of an active walk is flip-obstructing, then a
strictly shorter active walk with the *same endpoints* exists: a covered edge lets us drop the
obstructing middle vertex (reconnecting its neighbours through the shared parent) or, for an
`a — b — a` / `b — a — b` backtrack, excise the loop. The covered structure keeps every
neighbour's arrowhead orientation, so activity is preserved. The distinct-endpoint hypothesis
`hne` rules out the degenerate full-walk backtrack `[x, m, x]` (whose only excision `[x]` would
be too short); such a walk has equal endpoints and never arises between disjoint `X`, `Y`. -/

/-- **The analytic core (AMP, per-step invariance).** In a DAG `G`, if [the edge `a → b` is
covered — every other parent of `b` is also a parent of `a`, and vice versa](hyp:hcov), then
[the DAG obtained by reversing that edge to `b → a` is Markov equivalent to `G`: the two graphs
license exactly the same d-separation statements](goal). This is the single-edge kernel used by
the covered-reversal proof of the Verma--Pearl hard direction.

By `not_dSep_iff_hasActiveWalk` this is equivalent to: a covered-edge reversal preserves
active-walk connectivity (`HasActiveWalk`). Since the reversed edge `b → a` is again covered
in `flipEdge` and flipping it back yields `G`, it suffices to transport an active walk one way.
The only edge whose orientation changes is `a — b`; a walk not traversing it keeps its
collider pattern, and one that does is rerouted through the shared parents of `a` and `b`
(`hcov.2`), whose collider-activation (an `bbZAncestors Z` membership) is preserved because
`a` and `b` reach `Z` through the same ancestors. -/
