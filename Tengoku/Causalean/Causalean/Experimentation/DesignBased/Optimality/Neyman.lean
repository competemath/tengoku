# Neyman optimal allocation

For a two-arm experiment the randomization variance of the difference-in-means estimator, as a
function of the treatment fraction `x ∈ (0,1)`, has the form `A/x + B/(1−x)`. For positive
treated- and control-arm outcome variances, **Neyman allocation** chooses
`x* = √A / (√A + √B) ∈ (0,1)` and minimizes this variance. This file proves the analytic lower
bound and equality identity under nonnegative variances. In the zero-variance boundary cases the
totalized fraction is `0` or `1`, so the proved value comparison does not assert an interior
minimizer.

/-! # Neyman allocation

For positive arm variances, Neyman allocation minimizes the two-arm variance proxy by assigning
in proportion to standard deviations. Under merely nonnegative variances, this module's totalized
formula may lie at a boundary point.

The definitions `neymanFraction` and `neymanOptimalValue` package the fraction
`sqrt A / (sqrt A + sqrt B)` and the lower-bound value `(sqrt A + sqrt B)^2`. Theorems
`neyman_allocation_lower_bound`, `neyman_allocation_eq_at_fraction`, and
`neyman_fraction_value_le_on_Ioo` prove the lower bound, show equality at the totalized Neyman
fraction, and compare its value with every point of `(0, 1)`. The separate membership theorem
`neymanFraction_mem_Ioo` requires both variances to be positive.

/-- For [a first real-valued input](hyp:A) and [a second real-valued input](hyp:B), [the Neyman
allocation fraction](goal) is $\sqrt{A}/(\sqrt{A}+\sqrt{B})$. When the inputs are nonnegative
arm variances, this is the ratio of the treated arm's standard deviation to the sum of the two
arms' standard deviations. -/

fraction `x ∈ (0,1)`, the two-arm variance is at least `(√A + √B)²`.
