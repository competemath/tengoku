# Network-HAC variance estimator

Inference for a super-population network field needs a variance estimator that is robust to the
network dependence — the analog of a HAC / cluster-robust estimator.  Because far-apart units are
independent (m-dependence beyond the network), the variance of the network sum collapses to a sum
of within-neighborhood cross-products, so the natural estimator is

  `V̂ = ∑ᵢ ∑_{j ∈ N i} Xᵢ Xⱼ`,

i.e. the empirical sum of products over network-adjacent pairs.  This file defines that estimator
and records its **unbiasedness** anchor: under mean-zero summands its expectation is exactly the
variance of the network sum. Sequence-level consistency of `V̂` for the true variance along a
growing network is developed in the `SuperPopulation.Network.HAC` namespace.

/-- Given [a finite population of units](hyp:V), [a measurable sample space](hyp:Ω), [a measure on
that space](hyp:μ), [a super-population locally dependent network field](hyp:F), and
[a sample point](hyp:ω),
the [network-HAC variance estimator](goal) is the sum, over every unit and every unit in its closed
network neighborhood, of the product of their realized summands.  It targets the variance of the
network sum, whose cross-terms vanish outside the network neighborhoods. -/

/-- **Unbiasedness of the network-HAC estimator.** Under a probability measure with [square-
integrable summands](hyp:hL2) that are [mean zero](hyp:hmean), [the expectation of the
network-HAC estimator equals the variance of the network sum](goal): `E[V̂] = Var(∑ᵢ Xᵢ)`.

The off-neighborhood cross-covariances vanish by the m-dependence (non-adjacent summands are
independent, hence uncorrelated), so summing products over the neighborhoods recovers the full
covariance double sum. -/
