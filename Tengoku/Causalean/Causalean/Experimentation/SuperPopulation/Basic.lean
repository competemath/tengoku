# Super-population locally-dependent network field

The design-based experimentation substrate (`Experimentation/DesignBased/`) fixes the potential
outcomes and puts all randomness in the assignment, so its probability space is a finite product
measure over the treatment vector.  The **super-population / model-based** route is the opposite:
the units (and their outcomes) are themselves drawn from a population, the randomness is the
*sampling / population draw*, and the dependence between units is governed by a network rather
than by an assignment mechanism.  This file provides the base object for that route.

A `NetworkDependence` is the model-based sibling of `Causalean.Stat.IIDSample`: instead of mutual
independence (`iIndepFun`) it carries a **bounded-range / m-dependent** network — node-level
random summands `X i : Ω → ℝ` on a common ambient space `(Ω, μ)`, together with a reflexive,
symmetric adjacency relation such that index sets with no edge between them carry independent
summand tuples.  This is exactly the data of a dependency graph
(`DepGraph`), so `toDepGraph` exposes the field to the proved Stein
dependency-graph CLT (`stein_cdf_clt_of_depGraph`), which the `CLT` file specializes.

This is the m-dependent (exact-independence-beyond-the-network) layer.  Decaying-dependence
(ψ- or mixing) models, where far-apart nodes are only approximately independent, are a
different super-population abstraction and are not part of this module.

/-- A **super-population locally-dependent network field**: bundles [node-level random
summands](hyp:X) on a common ambient probability space together with [a network relation between
units](hyp:adj) that is [reflexive](hyp:refl) and [symmetric](hyp:symm), requires [every summand
to be measurable](hyp:meas), and requires [any two collections of units joined by no edge to carry
independent summand tuples](hyp:indep) (exact `m`-dependence beyond the network). This is the
model-based counterpart of the finite design — the randomness is the population draw, not the
assignment — and the m-dependence sibling of an i.i.d. sample. -/
