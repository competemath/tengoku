# m-dependent CLT for a super-population network field

For a sequence of super-population network fields (one per population size `n`) with bounded
degree `m`, uniformly bounded summands `|X i| ≤ Bₙ` shrinking with `Bₙ → 0` and `N·Bₙ³ → 0`,
mean-zero summands, and unit total variance, the network sum `∑ᵢ Xᵢ` converges in distribution
to the standard normal.  This is the model-based (super-population, network-dependence) analog of
the design-based `prodDesign_clt`, and is obtained by viewing the field as a Stein dependency
graph (`NetworkDependence.toDepGraph`) and invoking the proved bounded-degree dependency-graph CLT
`stein_cdf_clt_of_depGraph` — the m-dependence (exact independence beyond the network) is exactly
its leave-out independence hypothesis.

/-- **m-dependent network CLT (super-population).** Consider [a sequence of super-population
network fields `F n`, each on a probability space with measure `μ n`](hyp:μ,F), whose [dependency
graph has degree at most `m`](hyp:hdeg), whose [summands are uniformly bounded in absolute value
by a sequence `B n`](hyp:hB,hbound) [tending to zero](hyp:hB0) [fast enough that
`card(Vₙ)·(Bₙ)³ → 0`](hyp:hNB3), and whose [summands are mean zero](hyp:hmean) with [the network
sum having unit total variance for every `n`](hyp:hvar). Then [the network sum's cumulative
distribution function converges pointwise to the standard normal CDF:
`P[∑ᵢ (F n).X i ≤ s] → Φ(s)`](goal).

The randomness is the super-population draw `μ n`; the dependence is the network `(F n).adj`.
The proof reads off the dependency-graph hypotheses from the field and applies
`stein_cdf_clt_of_depGraph`. -/
