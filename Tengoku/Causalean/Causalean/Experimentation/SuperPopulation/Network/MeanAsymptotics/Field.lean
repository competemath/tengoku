# Centered/normalized network field for a super-population mean

To make the abstract m-dependent network CLT (`networkSum_clt`) usable for a concrete *mean*-type
estimand we must first turn raw network-dependent outcomes `Y i : Ω → ℝ` (with a common mean and a
positive sum-variance `s² = Var(∑ᵢ Yᵢ)`) into a `NetworkDependence` field whose summand is the
*standardized* contribution `Xᵢ = (Yᵢ − E[Yᵢ]) / s`.  This file performs that construction.

The only nontrivial field obligation is `indep`: the standardized tuple `fun k ∈ A => Xₖ` is an
affine, measurable function of the outcome tuple `fun k ∈ A => Yₖ`, so the outcome-level
m-dependence (non-adjacent outcome tuples independent) transfers to the standardized field by
`IndepFun.comp`.  The remaining structure data (the reflexive/symmetric network and measurability)
is inherited verbatim from the outcome-level hypotheses.

The three field hypotheses required by `networkSum_clt` — mean-zero, unit total variance, and the
uniform summand bound — are *derived* (not re-assumed) in `Hypotheses.lean`; the final CLT corollary
`networkMean_clt` lives in `AsymptoticNormality.lean`.

/-- Given [a finite population of units](hyp:V), [a measurable sample space](hyp:Ω), [a measure on
that space](hyp:μ), [a real-valued outcome for every unit and sample point](hyp:Y),
[a decidable relation between units](hyp:adj),
[the assumption that every unit is related to itself](hyp:hrefl), [the
assumption that this relation is symmetric](hyp:hsymm), [the assumption that every outcome is
measurable](hyp:hmeasY), [the assumption that outcome vectors for any two finite sets with no
relation joining them are independent](hyp:hindepY), and [a real normalizing constant](hyp:s), the
[centered and normalized network field](goal) has, for each unit, its outcome minus its expectation
under the given measure, divided by that constant; it retains the supplied relation and has
independent vectors on finite sets with no relation joining them.

The network relation, its decidability, reflexivity, symmetry, and the per-summand measurability are
inherited from the outcome-level data.  The independence field (non-adjacent standardized tuples are
independent) is *transferred* from the outcome m-dependence `hindepY` via `IndepFun.comp`, because
each standardized tuple `fun k ∈ A => Xₖ` is the affine measurable image
`v ↦ fun k => (v k − E[Yₖ])/s` of the outcome tuple `fun k ∈ A => Yₖ`. -/
