# Variance bound for the network-HAC variance estimator

The network-HAC estimator `V̂ = ∑ᵢ ∑_{j ∈ N i} Xᵢ Xⱼ` of a super-population locally-dependent
network field (`Causalean.Experimentation.SuperPopulation.NetworkDependence.netHACVarEst`) is
*itself* a sum of products over network-adjacent pairs.  Rewritten with `Finset.mul_sum` it is
exactly the localized double sum `∑ᵢ Xᵢ · (∑_{j ∈ N i} Xⱼ)` whose variance the proved
dependency-graph pair-counting bound
`Causalean.Mathlib.Probability.SteinMethod.DepGraph.var_nbhd_prod_le` controls.

This file records two facts.

* `netHACVarEst_variance_le` — the **estimator-variance bound**: for a single field with bounded
  summands `|Xᵢ| ≤ B` and bounded degree `m`, the variance of `V̂` is at most a polynomial in `m`
  times `card(V)·B⁴`, namely `2·m⁵·card(V)·B⁴`.  This is the substantive lemma: it is *derived*
  from the m-dependence (covariances of separated localized products vanish) and the
  bounded-degree pair counting, not assumed.

* `netHACVarEst_variance_tendsto_zero` — the **variance → 0** corollary: along a CLT-regime sequence
  with `B n → 0` and `card(V n)·(B n)³ → 0`, the estimator variance tends to zero (squeeze the
  bound, using `card·B⁴ = (card·B³)·B → 0`).

The consistency-in-probability statement is assembled in `Consistency.lean` from this variance
limit and the unbiasedness identity `netHACVarEst_integral_eq_variance` via Chebyshev.

/-- **Estimator-variance bound.** For a super-population network field `F`, given [a nonnegative
bound `B`](hyp:hB) such that [every summand is bounded in absolute value by `B`](hyp:hbound) and
[every network neighborhood has size at most `m`](hyp:hdeg), [the variance of the network-HAC
estimator `V̂ = ∑ᵢ ∑_{j∈N i} Xᵢ Xⱼ` is at most `2·m⁵·card(V)·B⁴`](goal).

This is the genuine content of the consistency argument: because non-adjacent summand tuples are
independent (the m-dependence `NetworkDependence.indep`), the covariance between two localized
products `Xᵢ·Tᵢ` and `Xⱼ·Tⱼ` vanishes unless `i, j` are within graph distance two; there are at
most `card(V)·m³` such pairs, each covariance bounded by `2(m·B²)²`.  Proved by reducing to the
dependency-graph pair-counting bound `var_nbhd_prod_le` on `F.toDepGraph`. -/

/-- **Estimator variance tends to zero.** Along a sequence of super-population network fields `F n`
in the CLT regime — bounded degree `m`, summands bounded by `B n` with `B n → 0`, and
`card(V n)·(B n)³ → 0` — the variance of the network-HAC estimator tends to zero.

Squeeze the bound `2·m⁵·card(V n)·(B n)⁴` from `netHACVarEst_variance_le`, which tends to zero
because `card(V n)·(B n)⁴ = (card(V n)·(B n)³)·(B n) → 0·0`.  This is the variance half of the
HAC-consistency statement (`netHAC_consistent`). -/
