# Waudby-Smith & Ramdas (2024): confidence sequences by betting

Worked application of the anytime-valid substrate to Waudby-Smith & Ramdas (2024), "Estimating means
of bounded random variables by betting" (JRSS-B).  To test that the mean of a `[0,1]`-bounded data
stream is `m`, a gambler bets a *predictable* fraction `λₙ` of current capital on each new
observation, multiplying capital by `1 + λₙ(Xₙ − m)`.  The resulting **capital process**
`Kₙ(m) = ∏ᵢ (1 + λᵢ(Xᵢ − m))` is, under the null that the conditional mean is `m` and with bets kept
in the range that keeps capital nonnegative, a **test supermartingale** (`IsTestSupermartingale`):
nonnegative, with `K₀ = 1`, and a fair bet cannot grow capital in expectation.  Inverting it —
keeping the values `m` whose capital has not yet reached `1/α` — yields a **confidence sequence**
for the mean with time-uniform coverage `1 − α`, directly via Ville's inequality.

/-- For [any sample space](hyp:Ω), [a real-valued sequence of observations](hyp:X), [a sequence
of real-valued betting fractions](hyp:lam), and [a candidate mean](hyp:m), the [betting capital
process](goal) is the process whose [initial capital is one](step:1) and whose [capital after
observation $n$ is the preceding capital multiplied by $1+\lambda_n(X_n-m)$](step:2). -/

/-- **The capital process is a test supermartingale** (the Waudby-Smith–Ramdas construction).
Consider a data stream `X` tested against a candidate mean `m` via betting fractions `lam`, all
adapted to a filtration `ℱ`. If [the capital process itself is adapted to `ℱ`](hyp:hadapt),
[each bet `lam n` is measurable with respect to the time-`n` information](hyp:hlam), [the
capital process, the centered increment `X n − m`, and the bet-scaled increment
`lam n · (X n − m)` are all integrable at every time `n`](hyp:hint,hintX,hintInc), [every
per-step return factor `1 + lam n (X n − m)` stays nonnegative](hyp:hbet), and [the conditional
mean of `X n − m` given the time-`n` information is zero, i.e. the bet is conditionally
fair](hyp:hfair), then [the betting capital process is a nonnegative test supermartingale for
`ℱ` under `μ`, with `E[K₀] ≤ 1`](goal). -/
