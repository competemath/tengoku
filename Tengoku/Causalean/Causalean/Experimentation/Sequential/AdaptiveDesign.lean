/-! # Adaptive sequential designs

Adaptive experiments allow each treatment probability to depend on the observed pre-assignment
history. Following Mathlib's discrete predictability convention, the initial propensity is
initial-information measurable and the propensity at time `t + 1` is measurable from the
information available at time `t`.

The structure `AdaptiveExperiment` packages the filtration and predictable propensity process.
Its overlap predicate records a positive margin separating every propensity from zero and one,
as required by inverse-propensity weighting, and `propensity_pos_of_overlap` extracts strict
positivity. Sequential inference for such designs is developed through the martingale layer.

/-- An adaptive sequential experiment: [a time-indexed information flow `ℱ` on the outcome
space](hyp:ℱ) together with [a propensity process `propensity`](hyp:propensity) recording the
treatment probability of the unit arriving at each time, subject to three conditions —
[the process is predictable: the time-`0` propensity is measurable with respect to the initial
information, and the time-`(t+1)` propensity depends only on the information available at time
`t`](hyp:propensity_predictable), [every propensity is nonnegative](hyp:propensity_nonneg), and
[every propensity is at most one](hyp:propensity_le_one). -/

/-- For [a measurable outcome space](hyp:Ω,m0), [an adaptive experiment on that space](hyp:E),
and [a real number serving as an overlap margin](hyp:δ), the [overlap condition with that
margin](goal) holds precisely when [the margin is strictly positive](step:1) and [at every time
and on every outcome history, the experiment's treatment probability lies between the margin and
one minus the margin](step:2).

This is the positivity condition that makes inverse-propensity
weighting, and hence the martingale construction underlying valid inference, well behaved. -/

/-- Under [overlap with margin `δ`](hyp:h), [every propensity is at least `δ`, hence strictly
positive — so inverse-propensity weights are finite](goal).
