/-! # Ville inequality

Ville's inequality bounds, under a probability law, the probability that a nonnegative
supermartingale ever crosses a positive level by its initial expected value divided by that level.
Because the bound holds simultaneously over time, it supports inference at data-dependent stopping
times.

This file packages test supermartingales as nonnegative supermartingales with initial expected
wealth at most one. It proves the finite-horizon maximal inequality under a finite measure by
optional stopping at a hitting time, passes to the time-uniform probability bound, and specializes
the crossing level to `1/α` for anytime-valid testing.

/-- Given [a sample space](hyp:Ω), [a σ-algebra on that space](hyp:m0),
[a real-valued process indexed by time](hyp:M), [a filtration on that σ-algebra](hyp:ℱ), and
[a measure on that measurable space](hyp:μ), a [test supermartingale](goal) is a
supermartingale adapted to that filtration whose value is nonnegative at every time and sample
point and whose expected initial value is at most one.

It is the wealth process of a bet against the null that cannot grow in expectation under it.

  The whole sequential stack is stated at finite-measure generality: nothing here uses total mass
  one. These are measure bounds, and they become statements about probability, type-I error and
  coverage exactly when a caller instantiates at a probability measure — which is what the
  inference-facing callers do. The names are read in that setting; the theorems are not restricted
  to it. -/

/-- **Finite-horizon supermartingale maximal inequality.** If
[`M` is a supermartingale under a finite measure](hyp:hM),
[`M` is everywhere nonnegative](hyp:hnonneg), [the level `λ` is positive](hyp:lam,hlam), and
[the horizon is `n`](hyp:n), then
[the crossing event has measure at most `E[M₀] / λ`](goal).

This is the supermartingale analogue of `MeasureTheory.maximal_ineq` (for nonnegative
submartingales); it is proved by optional stopping of the supermartingale at the hitting time of
`[λ,∞)`.
