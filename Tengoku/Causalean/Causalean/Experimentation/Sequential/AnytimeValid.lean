# Anytime-valid tests and confidence sequences

This file turns Ville's inequality for test supermartingales into reusable sequential-inference
objects under probability measures. An anytime-valid test rejects when wealth first reaches
`1/α`; Ville's inequality controls the probability of that event by `α`, regardless of when the
analyst stops. Dually, wealth inversion retains parameter values whose wealth remains below
`1/α`, producing simultaneous coverage at least `1 − α`.

The file defines the crossing event, the anytime-validity and confidence-sequence predicates, and
the two theorems that transfer Ville's probability bound to type-I error and miscoverage control.

/-- For [a sample space and a real-valued wealth process indexed by time and outcome](hyp:Ω,M),
and [a real-valued test level](hyp:α), the [sequential-test rejection region](goal) is the event
that the wealth reaches or exceeds $1/α$ at at least one time, with this quotient understood as
zero when $α=0$. -/
def rejectionRegion (M : ℕ → Ω → ℝ) (α : ℝ) : Set Ω := {ω | ∃ n, 1 / α ≤ M n ω}

/-- For [a measurable sample space](hyp:Ω,m0), [an event on that space](hyp:R),
[a probability measure on the sample space](hyp:μ), and [a real-valued test level](hyp:α),
[anytime validity at that level](goal) means that the event has measure at most $\max\{α,0\}$.

[`M` is a test supermartingale under the probability measure](hyp:hM) and
[the level `α` is positive](hyp:α,hα), then
[the crossing event has measure at most `α`](goal).

and [a real-valued level](hyp:α), the [wealth-inverted coverage predicate](goal) holds at a given
time and outcome
exactly when the wealth at that time is strictly less than $1/α$, with this quotient understood as
