# Staggered-adoption path helpers

Shared helpers for adoption paths encoded as `WithTop (Fin T)`, where `⊤`
represents the never-treated path.

/-! # Adoption Path Helpers

This file provides finite-period adoption-path predicates for staggered-treatment
designs, including eventual treatment, never treatment, and whether adoption has
occurred by a period. The never-treated path is represented as an infinite
adoption date, so absorbing treatment remains zero in every finite period for
such units.

These paper-agnostic helpers are shared by staggered-adoption modules:
Sun-Abraham path helpers wrap these declarations, and Goodman-Bacon uses the
same raw infinite-date encoding for proof stability. -/
