# Shared population cell substrate for panel estimand characterizations

Every genuine "population bridge" in `Panel/EstimandCharacterization/*` is the
same construction: a probability space `(Ω, μ)`, a finite measurable partition
of `Ω` into cells, and potential outcomes on `Ω`; each causal field of a
paper-specific finite structure is a **cell-conditional mean of a potential
outcome** (`normalizedRestrictedIntegral μ (cell i) f`), and the structure's consistency field
is *derived* from pointwise potential-outcome consistency on cells.

This file factors that shared substrate out once:

* `CellPartition μ ι` — a finite measurable partition of `Ω` (indexed by a
  `Fintype ι`) with positive-mass cells.
* `CellPartition.mass` / `CellPartition.mean` — the cell probability
  `π_i = ℙ(cell i)` and the cell-conditional mean `E[f ∣ cell i]`.
* the mass-sums-to-one identity, the finite-partition total law, and the
  congruence/algebra lemmas each paper's bridge reuses.

The canonical cell mean is `Causalean.Mathlib.Probability.normalizedRestrictedIntegral` (an event-level integral
divided by the event's real mass); `CellPartition.mean` is a thin wrapper so the
`normalizedRestrictedIntegral` algebra (`eventCondExp_congr_on`, `eventCondExp_sub`, the total
law `integral_eq_sum_measure_mul_eventCondExp`) is available cell-indexed.

/-! # Population cell partition

This file provides the shared finite-cell population substrate on which the
panel estimand-characterization population bridges are built: a finite
measurable partition of a probability space into positive-mass cells, together
with cell masses, cell-conditional means, and their basic identities. -/

/-- A finite measurable partition of a probability space `(Ω, μ)` into positive-mass
cells indexed by a finite type `ι`: [an assignment of a cell to each index](hyp:cell)
such that [every cell is measurable](hyp:cell_meas), [distinct cells are pairwise
disjoint](hyp:cell_disj), [the cells cover the whole space](hyp:cell_cov), and [every
cell has strictly positive probability mass](hyp:cell_pos). -/
structure CellPartition (μ : Measure Ω) (ι : Type*) [Fintype ι] where
  /-- The cell assigned to index `i` (e.g. `{ω | G ω = i}`). -/
  cell : ι → Set Ω
  /-- Each cell is measurable. -/
  cell_meas : ∀ i, MeasurableSet (cell i)
  /-- Distinct cells are disjoint. -/
  cell_disj : Pairwise (Function.onFun Disjoint cell)
  /-- The cells cover the whole space. -/
  cell_cov : (⋃ i, cell i) = Set.univ
  /-- Every cell has positive real mass. -/
  cell_pos : ∀ i, 0 < (μ (cell i)).toReal

/-- For [a measurable sample space](hyp:Ω), [a finite index set](hyp:ι), [a measure](hyp:μ), [a classifier assigning each sample point an index](hyp:g), [measurable classifier level sets](hyp:hmeas), and [strictly positive real mass for every level set](hyp:hpos), [the classifier-induced cell partition](goal) assigns each index its classifier level set.

Build a cell partition from a **finite classifier** `g : Ω → ι`: the cells
are the level sets `{ω | g ω = i}`. Disjointness and covering are automatic;
the caller supplies measurability and positive mass of each level set. This is
the common way panel bridges obtain their partition (cohort map, treated/untreated
classifier, cohort-period map, …). -/
