# Panel consistency

Consistency is an assumption relating independently stored factual outcomes to
the corresponding potential outcomes at the realized exposure.  It is stated
only for observed cells `r ∈ R`, the support on which the panel records
outcomes and weights.

/-! # Panel Consistency

This file states the panel consistency property for a `PanelPOSystem`. The
predicate `PanelPOSystem.observedY_eq_potentialOutcome` is the pointwise
observed-cell equality, while `PanelConsistency` requires it for every observed
cell and sample point. The lemma `panelConsistency_holds` exposes the equality
directly from the assumption. -/

/-- For [a panel potential-outcomes system](hyp:P), [an observed unit-period cell](hyp:r,hr),
and [a sample point](hyp:ω), [pointwise consistency is the assertion that the factual observed
outcome equals the potential outcome at that cell under the exposure realized at that sample
point](goal). -/
