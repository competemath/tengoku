# Observed panel cells with positive normalized weights

This file formalizes a finite collection of **observed unit-period cells**
`R ⊆ I × T` together with strictly positive weights `ω_r` summing to 1
over `R`.

`Cells I T` is a thin specialization of the generic
`Causalean.Stat.Weighted.WeightedSupport (I × T)`. All algebraic
substrate (`ip`, `ipMat`, `proj`, `residualize`, `tildeX`, `tildeXVec`,
`Q_XX`, `rhsVec`, `thetaHat`, `RankCondition`) is inherited transparently
through the `abbrev`, and dot-notation `c.ip A B`, `c.tildeX H X`, etc.,
resolves to the `WeightedSupport.*` declarations.

The panel-specific `balanced` constructor (which depends on
`Fintype.card I * Fintype.card T`) is retained here.

## Main definitions

* `Cells I T` — abbreviation for `WeightedSupport (I × T)`.
* `Cells.balanced` — the balanced-panel special case
  `R = I × T`, `ω = 1 / (|I| · |T|)`.

/-! # Observed Panel Cells

This file provides the observed-cell substrate for panel regressions: a finite
set of observed unit-period cells with strictly positive normalized weights. It
specializes the generic weighted-support infrastructure to panel cell indices
and supplies the balanced-panel constructor.

**Relation to `Causalean.Panel.CellBridge`.** Both files use the word *cell*,
but for different objects. Here a cell is a **discrete index** `r = (i, t) ∈ I × T`
carrying a positive normalized weight — a finite-weighted-support object with no
measure theory. In `CellBridge` a cell is a **measurable level set**
`{ω | G ω = g}` of an observable map on a probability space. The two share no
declarations and neither imports the other; the only common substrate is
`Causalean.Stat.Weighted.IndicatorSpan`. -/
