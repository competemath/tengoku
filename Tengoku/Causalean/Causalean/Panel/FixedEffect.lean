# Two-way fixed-effect subspace

For `c : Cells I T`, the **two-way fixed-effect subspace** `H_twfe` is the
linear subspace of `(I × T) → ℝ` consisting of arrays of the form
`h (i, t) = a i + b t` for some `a : I → ℝ` and `b : T → ℝ`.

`H_twfe` is a thin specialization of the generic two-axis additive span
`Causalean.Stat.Weighted.twoAxisAdditiveSpan I T`
(itself `Causalean.Stat.Weighted.AdditiveSpan (Prod.fst) (Prod.snd)`).
All algebraic properties (constants membership, finite-dimensionality)
are inherited from the generic API.

## Main definitions

* `Cells.H_twfe : Submodule ℝ ((I × T) → ℝ)` — the two-way fixed-effect
  subspace, defined as `Causalean.Stat.Weighted.twoAxisAdditiveSpan I T`.

## Main lemmas

* `Cells.const_mem_H_twfe` — constants are in `H_twfe`.
* `Cells.H_twfe_finiteDimensional` — `H_twfe` is finite-dimensional.

/-! # Two-Way Fixed Effects

This file defines the two-way fixed-effect subspace of panel arrays as the set
of unit-plus-period additive functions. It connects the panel notation to the
generic additive-span infrastructure and records basic membership and
finite-dimensionality facts. -/
