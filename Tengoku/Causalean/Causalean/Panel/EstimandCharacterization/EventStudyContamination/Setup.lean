/-! # Sun-Abraham Event-Study Setup

This file provides the finite staggered-adoption event-study system used by the
Sun-Abraham characterization modules. It defines the cohort, period,
relative-time, potential-outcome, and comparison-path primitives on which the
conventional and interaction-weighted estimands are built. -/

This is the path-level analogue of `Consistency` for arbitrary adoption
paths `h : WithTop (Fin T)`: in any finite period `t` where path `h` is
untreated (`absorbingTreatment h t = 0`), the factual observed path mean equals
the never-treated potential-outcome path mean. It is the honest causal primitive

/-- **G1 faithfulness corollary.** When the calendar-time map `time` is
injective (the usual one-period-per-relative-time encoding), the cell-averaged
`CATT g e` collapses to the source's *point* `CATT_{g,e}` at the unique period
`t` realizing relative time `e`, i.e. `treatedMean g t - untreatedMean g t`.

This certifies that the cell-averaged `CATT` equals the source's
point-period object exactly in the injective setting the paper assumes; the
main theorems hold for the (wider) cell-averaged class and specialize here. -/
