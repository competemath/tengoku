# Finite-partition OLS weights with heterogeneous effects

Pure finite-cell algebra for saturated-OLS overlap weights. It proves:

* the saturated OLS estimand decomposes as `Σ ω_g τ_g`, with
  `ω_g ∝ π_g p_g (1−p_g)`;
* if every `p_g = 1/2`, the overlap weights collapse to cell probabilities;
* if `τ` is constant, the saturated OLS estimand is that constant.

An assumed two-component ATT/ATU representation is recorded separately as the
algebraic scaffold `AssumedTwoComponentOLS`. Its corollaries do not derive the
representation from an OLS projection.

This file is pure finite-cell algebra. The symbols `π`, `p`, and `τ` stand for
cell probabilities, treated shares, and cell-level effects in the finite
partition. Their probability-space interpretation — including
`τ_g = E[Y(1)−Y(0) ∣ G=g]` built from potential outcomes under the finite-cell
bridge condition — is supplied by `bridge_finite_residualized_eq_overlap` in
`OverlapWeightedATE.lean`, where `partitionOf` instantiates this structure from
a probability space. See `OverlapWeightedATE.lean` for that bridge.

The motivating NL artifact is:
`doc/basic_concepts/po/estimand_characterization/sloczynski_ols_heterogeneous.md`.
The algebra here does not derive the paper's treated-versus-untreated
representation; `AssumedTwoComponentOLS` stores that representation as input.

/-! # Finite-Partition OLS Algebra

This file formalizes finite-cell saturated ordinary least squares weights with
heterogeneous treatment effects. It defines
`FinitePartition`, `cellOverlap`, `overlapWeight`, and
`overlapWeightedATE`, proves the normalized-weight identity
`finite_weights_eq_sum`, and records the equal-share and homogeneous-effect
collapses. It also defines `perTreatedWeight` and `perUntreatedWeight` for the
per-observation leverage interpretation, and `AssumedTwoComponentOLS` for a
separate ATT/ATU algebraic scaffold whose two-component identity and
equal-dispersion weight are supplied as fields. -/

In the finite-cell overlap formula, each treated observation in cell `g` has
the leverage factor `1 − p_g`, while each untreated observation has the
factor `p_g`. This definition makes the first factor explicit; see
`perTreatedWeight_antitone`, `perUntreatedWeight_monotone`, and
`cellOverlap_eq_perWeights_mul` for the main monotonicity claims. -/

/-- For [a finite covariate partition](hyp:P) and [one of its cells](hyp:g),
the [per-untreated-observation leverage factor](goal) is $p_g$, the treated
share in that cell.

Each untreated observation in cell `g` contributes a leverage factor of
`p_g` (the treated share). Cells with more treated units (high `p_g`) give
each untreated unit a larger per-observation weight; cells with fewer
treated units (low `p_g`) give each untreated unit a smaller weight.
See `perUntreatedWeight_monotone`. -/

/-- The cell overlap variance is the product of the two per-observation

/-- **Monotonicity of the per-treated factor.** The per-treated-observation
leverage factor `1 − p_g` is antitone in the treated share: if [cell `g` has a
treated share no larger than cell `h`'s](hyp:hph), then [`g`'s per-treated-observation
leverage factor is at least `h`'s:
`perTreatedWeight P h ≤ perTreatedWeight P g`](goal).

In words: the *minority* treatment-status group in a cell receives the
larger per-observation weight. A cell where almost everyone is treated
(`p_g ≈ 1`) downweights each treated observation to near 0; a cell where
almost no one is treated (`p_g ≈ 0`) upweights each treated observation
toward 1.

This is a property of the finite-cell overlap factors; it is not the paper's
ATT/ATU group-weight representation. -/

then [`h`'s per-untreated-observation leverage factor is at least `g`'s:
`perUntreatedWeight P g ≤ perUntreatedWeight P h`](goal).

Symmetrically to `perTreatedWeight_antitone`: the minority
untreated group in a cell receives the larger per-observation weight. -/
