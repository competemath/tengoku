# Grounding the BJS panel in a staggered-adoption two-way fixed-effect design

The abstract `BJSPanel` of `Imputation.lean` uses free index types for the
treated and untreated cells.  This file closes that scope gap (audit G5)
*constructively*: it exhibits `BJSPanel` as an instance built from genuine panel
primitives — units `I`, periods `Fin T`, and a staggered-adoption path
`g : I → WithTop (Fin T)` (with `⊤` the never-treated path, via
`Causalean.Panel.AdoptionPath`).

Treated cells are those whose treatment has switched on (`g i ≤ t`); untreated
cells are those still untreated (`t < g i`), which — faithfully to BJS — include
every never-treated cell *and* every pre-adoption cell of a treated unit.  The
regressor design is the canonical two-way fixed-effect block `I ⊕ Fin T`, so the
untreated-outcome model `E[Y_{it}(0)] = α_i + λ_t` holds by construction and the
BJS identification hypotheses discharge down to a concrete staggered panel.

/-! # BJS staggered-adoption grounding

Builds a `BJSPanel` from an adoption path and two-way fixed effects, and proves
the untreated-outcome model and fixed-effect hypotheses hold for it. Treated
cells are the cells whose treatment has switched on, untreated cells include
never-treated cells and pre-adoption cells, and the canonical two-way
fixed-effect design discharges the BJS hypotheses in a concrete panel.  The main
definitions are `TreatedCell`, `UntreatedCell`, `feRow`, and
`ofStaggeredTWFE`; the main theorem bridges are
`ofStaggeredTWFE_untreatedModel` and `ofStaggeredTWFE_treatmentFixed`. -/
