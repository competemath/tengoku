# Borusyak-Jaravel-Spiess finite imputation event-study algebra

Finite-cell, paper-specific population characterization of the BJS imputation
functional. Treated and untreated panel cells are modeled directly as finite
index types. Companion modules supply unit/time grounding and a separate
full-design OLS variance comparison; they do not prove that `psiImp` is BLUE.

/-! # Borusyak-Jaravel-Spiess Imputation

This file gives a finite-cell population formulation of the
Borusyak-Jaravel-Spiess imputation functional.  The core structure `BJSPanel`
stores treated and untreated cell rows, target weights, observed and untreated
cell means, the untreated-outcome nuisance vector, and treated-cell effects.
It defines the target `theta`, prediction-span witnesses `ImputationWeights`,
the observed imputation functional `psiImp`, and the identification theorem
`bjs_imputation_identification`.  It also defines the finite linear-estimator
API and the witness lemma `linear_unbiased_of_imputation_representation`; the
substrate-based construction of those witnesses lives in `PanelBridge.lean`. -/

## Note on the Full-Design Variance Comparison

The companion file
`Causalean/Panel/EstimandCharacterization/ImputationEventStudy/FullDesignGaussMarkov.lean`
contains `BJSPanel.bjs_full_design_ols_min_variance_spherical`, which proves a narrower
full-column-rank Gauss–Markov variance inequality for the OLS weight of
`designFull`. It does not identify that weight with `ImputationWeights` or
`psiImp`, and therefore does not by itself formalize the paper's claim that the
concrete imputation estimator is BLUE. The inequality is built on the finite
Gauss-Markov layer under `Causalean/Stat/LinearModel/GaussMarkov/`:

1. `GaussMarkov.quadVar Σ w = wᵀ Σ w` — the variance quadratic form, justified
   probabilistically by `GaussMarkov.variance_linearCombination`
   (`Var(∑ wᵢ Yᵢ) = wᵀ Σ w` with `Σ i j = cov(Yᵢ, Yⱼ)`).
2. `GaussMarkov.SphericalErrors Σ σ : Σ = σ² • I` (and the random-family form
   `GaussMarkov.SphericalFamily`).
3. `GaussMarkov.olsWeight X c = X (XᵀX)⁻¹ c` — the normal-equations inverse
   OLS weight, with `olsWeight_vecMul_eq` and `olsWeight_mem_colSpan`.
4. `GaussMarkov.quadVar_spherical_le_of_colSpan` /
   `quadVar_le_of_mulVec_mem_colSpan` — the quadratic-form ordering theorems
   (column-span weight ⟂ left-null-space, so Pythagoras gives the comparison),
   and `linearCombination_variance_spherical_le_of_colSpan` /
   `linearCombination_variance_le_of_covMul_mem_colSpan` lift these to actual
   `ProbabilityTheory.variance`.

The full-design theorem instantiates
`linearCombination_variance_spherical_le_of_colSpan` at
`BJSPanel.designFull` (a treated-cell indicator block stacked with the covariate
block). The hoisted facts `LinearEstimator.vT_eq_a` and
`LinearEstimator.nuisance_coord` supply the unbiasedness ↔ design-constraint
bridge.

The theorems in *this* file (`bjs_imputation_identification`,
`bjs_linear_unbiased_iff_imputation_form`,
`linear_unbiased_of_prediction_identified`) cover the
**identification + linear-unbiased characterization** half;
`FullDesignGaussMarkov.lean` covers the **full-design variance-comparison** half.

## Note on `PredictionIdentified` sufficient conditions (G8)

`PredictionIdentified` is defined as `Nonempty P.ImputationWeights` — a
correct propositional existence wrapper, but opaque without a constructive
sufficient condition.  The natural sufficient condition from the paper is:

> For every treated cell `c` with `a c ≠ 0`, the row `qT c` lies in the
> column span of the untreated regressor matrix `(qU u r)_{u,r}`.

A corollary `PredictionIdentified_of_span_rows` could be stated as:

```
theorem PredictionIdentified_of_span_rows
    (hSpan : ∀ c : Treated, P.a c ≠ 0 →
      qT c ∈ Submodule.span ℝ (Set.range P.qU)) :
    P.PredictionIdentified
```

Proving this requires constructing explicit `weight : Treated → Untreated → ℝ`
from the `Submodule.span` membership certificates — specifically extracting
the finite linear-combination coefficients from
`Finsupp.mem_span_range_iff_exists_finsupp` or
`Basis.coord`-style decomposition of `qT c` in the `qU`-span.  This
construction is available in Mathlib but requires non-trivial plumbing between
`Finsupp`, `Fintype.linearCombination`, and the `ImputationWeights.weight`
function type.  It is deferred until the `FiniteLinearAlgebra` helper module
(see `doc/basic_concepts/…`) provides a cleaner interface.

In the meantime, callers can directly construct `ImputationWeights` when they
have an explicit coefficient matrix (the common case in finite examples), and
wrap it with `⟨⟨weight, row_identity⟩⟩ : P.PredictionIdentified`.
