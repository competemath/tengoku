# Borusyak-Jaravel-Spiess (2024): population bridge to the finite BJS panel

Anchors the abstract `BJSPanel` (whose mean fields are free reals) to a genuine
probability space carrying potential outcomes. A `BJSPopulation` bundles
`(Ω, μ)`, a treated/untreated cell classifier `cellOf : Ω → Treated ⊕ Untreated`,
and potential outcomes `Y0` (untreated), `Y1` (treated), and observed `Yobs`.
Its `toPanel` fills every mean field of `BJSPanel` with a cell-conditional mean
of a potential-outcome slice; in particular the treated-cell effect `tau c`
becomes the genuine population contrast `E[Y(1) − Y(0) ∣ cell c]`.

The `TreatmentEffectFixed` restriction and the observed-equals-untreated clause
of `UntreatedOutcomeModel` are **derived** from cell-level consistency (the
observed outcome is the treated/untreated potential outcome on treated/untreated
cells). Only the additive untreated-outcome model `E[Y(0) ∣ cell] = q · β₀` — the
paper's fixed-effect / parallel-trends restriction — remains a modeling
hypothesis, supplied to the discharge lemma.

/-! # Borusyak-Jaravel-Spiess imputation population bridge

This file constructs a finite `BJSPanel` from a probability space with treated
and untreated potential outcomes, defining its mean fields as treated/untreated
cell conditional means and deriving the untreated-consistency and fixed-effect
restrictions from cell-level potential-outcome consistency. -/
