identities and inequalities known for every measurable set integral.

/-- If [a weight function `w` is integrable with respect to a reference measure `μ`](hyp:hwint)
and [a finite measure `ν`'s mass on every measurable event `A` equals, as a real number, the
integral of `w` over `A` against `μ`](hyp:hν), then [`ν` is obtained from `μ` by weighting with
the nonnegative part of `w`: `ν = μ.withDensity (fun x => ENNReal.ofReal (w x))`](goal). -/

/-- A measurable function is bounded in absolute value by one almost everywhere if the
absolute value of its integral over every measurable event is at most that event's measure.

No global integrability assumption is needed: the proof restricts attention to bounded
slices on which the function is automatically integrable, then exhausts the regions above
one and below minus one. -/
