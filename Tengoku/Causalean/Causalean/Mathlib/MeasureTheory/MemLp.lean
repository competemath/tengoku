# MemLp from square-integrability

This file proves `MemLp.of_measurable_of_integral_sq_le`, which turns an explicit
integrability witness for the squared norm of an almost-everywhere strongly measurable
function into membership of that function in L².

/-- If [a normed-vector-space-valued function `f` is almost-everywhere strongly measurable with
respect to `Q`](hyp:hf_meas) and [the squared norm `‖f x‖^2` is integrable against
`Q`](hyp:h_sq_int), then [`f` belongs to $L^2(Q)$](goal).

The explicit integrability hypothesis is essential:
Mathlib's Bochner integral convention makes a bare upper bound on
`∫ x, f x ^ 2 ∂Q` vacuous for non-integrable squares.
