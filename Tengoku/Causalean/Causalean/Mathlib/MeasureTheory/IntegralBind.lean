# Bochner integral against a `Measure.bind`

Mathlib provides `MeasureTheory.Measure.lintegral_bind` for the lower Lebesgue
integral, but no analogue for the Bochner integral.  This file supplies the
missing bridge: integrating a Bochner-integrable function against the Giry-monad
bind `m.bind κ` equals the iterated integral `∫ a, ∫ x, f x ∂κ a ∂m`.

This is a purely measure-theoretic statement over generic types and a generic
normed space, with the standard measurability and integrability side-conditions.

/-! # Bochner Integrals Against Measure Binds

This file proves Bochner-integral identities for Giry-monad binds and for binds whose
fibres are pushforwards. These identities convert an integral against a bound measure
into the corresponding iterated integral, supporting nested-kernel calculations in the
causal and statistical parts of the library.

The main public results are `integral_bind`, `integral_bind_map`,
`integral_bind_bind_map`, `integral_bind_of_ae_eq_const`, `map_bind_bind_map_proj`, and
`integral_bind_bind_map_proj`. Together they cover one-level binds, bind-then-map
integrals, doubly nested bind-then-map integrals, fibrewise constant collapses, and
projection back to a reattached base coordinate. -/

/-- If [`κ` is a measurable family of measures, one per point of the base space (a measurable
kernel)](hyp:hκ) and [`f` is Bochner-integrable against the measure `m.bind κ` obtained by
mixing `κ` over the base measure `m`](hyp:hf), then [the Bochner integral of `f` against
`m.bind κ` equals the iterated integral: first integrate `f` against `κ a` for each base
point `a`, then integrate the result against `m`](goal). This is the Bochner analogue of
`MeasureTheory.Measure.lintegral_bind`. -/

pushforward measure `(κ a).map (g a)` is itself measurable](hyp:hgm), and [`f` is
Bochner-integrable against the mixed measure `m.bind (fun a => (κ a).map (g a))`](hyp:hf).
Then [the Bochner integral of `f` against that mixed measure equals the iterated integral
of the pulled-back integrand `a ↦ ∫ x, f (g a x) ∂κ a` against the base measure `m`](goal).
This packages a single application of `integral_bind` with the fibrewise
`MeasureTheory.integral_map`, supplying the bridge needed to expand a nested bind-then-map
Bochner integral. -/

measure forward along `π` returns exactly the base measure `m`](goal). This is the underlying
measure identity behind `integral_bind_bind_map_proj`, stated without any integrability or
integrand hypotheses: the two inner probability fibres each contribute total mass one over a
fixed base point, so transporting back along `π` returns `m` unchanged (no hypothesis on `m`
is needed). It is the bridge for marginalising a nested Giry-monad construction onto its
reattached coordinate when only measurability of the eventual integrand is available. -/
