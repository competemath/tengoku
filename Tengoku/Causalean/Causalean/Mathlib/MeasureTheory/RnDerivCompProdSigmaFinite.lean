# Radon–Nikodym derivative of a composition-product against a σ-finite fibre reference

Mathlib's `ProbabilityTheory.rnDeriv_compProd`
(`Mathlib/Probability/Kernel/Composition/RadonNikodym.lean`) computes
`(μ ⊗ₘ κ).rnDeriv (ν ⊗ₘ η)` but leaves the conditional factor as
`(μ ⊗ₘ κ).rnDeriv (μ ⊗ₘ η)` rather than the fibre derivative `∂κ/∂η`, and its
kernel Radon–Nikodym API requires the reference **kernel** to be finite.

This file proves the product-reference formula used when a composition product is
compared against a product reference `ν ×ₘ ρ`.  It takes product
a.e.-measurability of the raw per-slice fibre derivative
`(a, b) ↦ (dκ_a/dρ)(b)` as an explicit hypothesis; with that representative in
hand the fibre reference `ρ` need only be **σ-finite**, so the public theorem
`rnDeriv_compProd_prod_sigmaFinite` covers continuous references (Lebesgue), not
just finite/discrete ones.  It takes the μ-a.e. fibre domination `κ_a ≪ ρ`
directly as a hypothesis (rather than re-deriving it from joint domination, which
would route through the finite kernel `Kernel.const α ρ`), and assembles the
formula by `withDensity` bookkeeping that never needs `ρ` to be finite.

The remaining Mathlib gap is only in *constructing* that measurable fibre density
automatically: when `ρ` is infinite, `Kernel.const α ρ` is not a finite kernel, so
the current kernel RN API cannot build a jointly measurable σ-finite
representative.  Callers that already possess such a representative (for instance
from a stepwise fibre Radon–Nikodym assumption) obtain the full σ-finite formula
here.

/-- **σ-finite-reference Radon–Nikodym derivative of a composition-product.** Fix an s-finite
measure `μ`, a σ-finite base reference `ν`, a σ-finite fibre reference `ρ`, and an s-finite
kernel `κ` from the base space to the fibre space, together with [a candidate base density
`f`](hyp:f). If [`μ` is absolutely continuous with respect to `ν`](hyp:hμν), [`μ`-almost every
fibre `κ a` is absolutely continuous with respect to `ρ`](hyp:hfiber), [the raw per-slice
fibre derivative `(a, b) ↦ (dκ_a/dρ)(b)` is almost-everywhere measurable with respect to the
product reference `ν × ρ`](hyp:hfiber_meas), and [`f` agrees `ν`-almost everywhere with the
Radon–Nikodym derivative `dμ/dν`](hyp:hf), then [the Radon–Nikodym derivative of the
composition-product `μ ⊗ₘ κ` with respect to the product reference `ν × ρ` agrees, `ν × ρ`-almost
everywhere, with the pointwise product `(a, b) ↦ f a · (dκ_a/dρ)(b)` of the base density and the
fibre derivative](goal). -/
