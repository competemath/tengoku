# Choquet capacities on Polish spaces

This file isolates the small piece of Choquet capacity theory needed to prove universal
measurability of analytic sets.  A capacity is represented directly as a set function, with
continuity from below, finite values on compact sets, and right-continuity through open
neighborhoods of compact sets.  The main theorem is the Choquet capacitability theorem specialized
to Mathlib's topological `MeasureTheory.AnalyticSet`.

The formulation deliberately avoids introducing a second notion of analytic set or a general
paving library.  It follows the hypotheses used in Kechris, *Classical Descriptive Set Theory*,
Theorem 30.13, and is sufficient for the outer measure of a finite Borel measure.
