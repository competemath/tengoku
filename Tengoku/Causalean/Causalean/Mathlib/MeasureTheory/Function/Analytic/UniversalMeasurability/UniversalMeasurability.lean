# Universal measurability of analytic sets

This file converts Choquet capacitability for the outer measure of a finite Borel measure into
membership in the completed sigma-algebra.  Its main declaration is the public universal
measurability theorem for Mathlib's `MeasureTheory.AnalyticSet`.

/-- On a Polish sample space equipped with its Borel σ-algebra, if [a set `s` is
analytic](hyp:hs), then [`s` is null-measurable for every finite Borel measure `μ`: it becomes
measurable after completing `μ`, so it differs from an ordinary measurable event only on a
`μ`-null set](goal). -/
