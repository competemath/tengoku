# Completed measurability of upper-semi-analytic losses

This file provides only the function-level compatibility needed by downstream statistical
applications: an extended-nonnegative function whose strict superlevel sets are analytic is
measurable on the completion of every finite Borel measure, and its completed lower integral agrees
with the lower integral computed against the original measure.
