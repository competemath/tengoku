# Measurability of parametric Lp-norm functionals

For a parameter-dependent function `g : Ω → X → E` valued in a Borel normed
additive group, the map
`ω ↦ (eLpNorm (g ω) p P).toReal` is measurable at every finite nonzero exponent
`p`, provided `g` is jointly
measurable in `(ω, x)`.

This file provides two flavours, both consequences of Tonelli for the
parametric integral `ω ↦ ∫⁻ x, ‖g ω x‖₊^p.toReal ∂P` followed by the post-processing
`(·)^(1/p.toReal)` and `.toReal`:

* `measurable_eLpNorm_toReal_of_uncurry`  — top-σ-algebra version: from
  joint measurability of `Function.uncurry g`.
* `measurable_eLpNorm_toReal_of_uncurry_of_factor`  — sub-σ-algebra
  version: from joint measurability wrt the sub-σ-algebra product.

These are general measurability facts for parameterized Lp seminorms.

/-! # Measurability of Parametric Lp Norms

This file proves that the parameter map sending a jointly measurable integrand to
its finite nonzero Lp norm under a fixed measure is measurable. It supplies a Tonelli-based
measurability tool for parameterized families of functions.

The top-σ-algebra lemma is `measurable_eLpNorm_toReal_of_uncurry`; the
sub-σ-algebra version, where joint measurability factors through
`mΩ × MeasurableSpace X`, is
`measurable_eLpNorm_toReal_of_uncurry_of_factor`. -/

/-- **Lp-norm measurable from joint measurability (top σ-algebra).** For a σ-finite base measure
`P` and [an exponent `p` that is neither zero](hyp:hp_zero) [nor infinite](hyp:hp_top), if [the
map `(ω, x) ↦ g ω x` is jointly measurable on the product of `Ω` and `X`](hyp:hg), then [the
real-valued Lp norm `ω ↦ ‖g ω‖_{Lp(P)}` is measurable as a function of `ω`](goal).

**Proof sketch.** `(eLpNorm (g ω) p P).toReal =
  ((∫⁻ x, ‖g ω x‖₊^p.toReal ∂P)^(1/p.toReal)).toReal`.  Use:
* `Measurable.lintegral_prod_right` (Tonelli) on `(ω, x) ↦ ‖g ω x‖₊^p.toReal` —
  joint measurable from `hg` via `Measurable.pow_const` and `enorm`.
* `Measurable.pow_const` for the `(1/p.toReal)` power.
* `ENNReal.measurable_toReal` for the final `.toReal`. -/
