/-! # Cancellation for reciprocal real densities

This file supplies a real-valued form of density cancellation: weighting a
measure by the nonnegative density `1 / h` and then by `h` recovers the
original measure whenever `h` is positive almost everywhere.

/-- For [a measure](hyp:μ), [a measurable real function](hyp:h,hh), and the assumption that
[the function is positive almost everywhere](hyp:hpos), [weighting the measure first by
`max(1/h,0)` and then by `max(h,0)` recovers the original measure](goal). -/
