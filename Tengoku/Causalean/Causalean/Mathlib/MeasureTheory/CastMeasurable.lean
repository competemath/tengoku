/-! # Measurability of transport along an equality of indices

Moving a value between the fibres of an indexed family along a proof that the two indices are
equal does not disturb measurability, and neither does transporting the codomain index of a
measurable function. Both facts are immediate once the index equality is substituted away, but
they are needed wherever an indexed family is re-indexed, so they are stated once here.
