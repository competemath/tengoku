# Integrability of suprema over a countable-dense-skeletoned index class

This file proves measurability and integrability of pointwise suprema over arbitrary index sets by
reducing them to uniformly bounded families on countable dense skeletons.

The API works on an arbitrary measurable space and reduces measurability and
Bochner-integrability side conditions to countable suprema.

Main results:
* `sSup_image_eq_of_dense_tendsto` — for a real functional `F` bounded above on `S`, if
  every `x ∈ S` is reached by a `D`-valued sequence along which `F` converges to `F x`,
  then the supremum over `S` equals the supremum over the countable skeleton `D`.
* `measurable_sSup_image_of_countable_dense` — the pointwise supremum `ω ↦ sSup (F ω '' S)`
  is measurable, given a countable `D`, per-index measurability on `D`, and the skeleton
  supremum-equality for every `ω`.
* `integrable_sSup_image_of_countable_dense` — on a finite measure, the same supremum is
  integrable, given in addition a uniform bound `|F ω π| ≤ C` over `S`; the accompanying
  `bddAbove_image_of_bound` supplies the pointwise `BddAbove` fact for free.
