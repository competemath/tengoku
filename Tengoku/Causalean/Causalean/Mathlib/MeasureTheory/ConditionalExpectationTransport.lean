/-! # Conditional-expectation bounds and law transport

This file proves preservation of deterministic almost-everywhere bounds by conditional
expectation, a real-valued Doob--Dynkin factorization, and transport of almost-everywhere
properties, integrability, integrals, and a conditional-mean identity across equality of
pushforward measures.
