# Conditional expectation under a change of measure

This file proves the abstract Bayes formula for conditional expectation when a
probability measure is changed by a nonnegative normalized density.  It also
specializes the formula to normalized exponential tilts by bounded measurable
functions; strict positivity of an exponential density upgrades the conclusion
from tilted-almost-everywhere to base-almost-everywhere.

/-- **Conditional Bayes formula for bounded exponential tilts.** If [the conditioning
σ-algebra is contained in the ambient one](hyp:hm), [the score is measurable](hyp:hs_meas)
and [bounded](hyp:hs_bound), and [the target is integrable under the normalized
exponential tilt](hyp:hf), then [the conditional Bayes ratio for the density
`exp (t s) / ∫ exp (t s) dμ` holds almost everywhere under the base measure](goal).

Boundedness makes the exponential integrable and its normalizer finite and strictly
positive.  The density is therefore strictly positive, so the tilted and base measures
have the same null sets. -/
