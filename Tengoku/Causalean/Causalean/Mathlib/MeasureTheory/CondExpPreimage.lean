# Conditional expectation identified on measurable preimages

This module packages the uniqueness characterization of conditional expectation in the
form where restricted integrals agree on every measurable preimage of a generating map.

/-- [The conditional expectation of one integrable real function equals another almost
everywhere](goal) for [a finite measure](hyp:mu) and [a measurable generating
map](hyp:design,hdesign), provided [both functions are integrable](hyp:Y,m,hY,hm), [the second
is strongly measurable for the pullback σ-algebra](hyp:hm_design), and [their restricted
integrals agree on every measurable preimage](hyp:hintegral).

Global integrability of the second function supplies integrability on the finite
conditioning events, while finiteness of the measure supplies the sigma-finiteness
required by Mathlib's conditional-expectation uniqueness theorem. -/
