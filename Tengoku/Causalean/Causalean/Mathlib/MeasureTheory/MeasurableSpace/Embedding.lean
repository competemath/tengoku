/-! # Measurable Embedding Extras

This file collects general measure-theoretic facts about measurable embeddings that are
independent of the library's structural causal model and SWIG infrastructure. Its main
result, `restrict_range_eq_of_forall_image`, shows that agreement on all embedded
measurable images implies agreement after restricting both measures to the embedding
range. -/

/-- If `F` is [a measurable embedding of one measurable space into another](hyp:hF) and
    [two measures `μ` and `ν` on the codomain assign the same mass to the image `F '' A` of
    every measurable set `A` in the domain](hyp:h), then [restricting `μ` and `ν` to the range
    of `F` yields identical measures](goal).

    Proof: by `MeasurableEmbedding.comap_apply`, the assumption shows
    `μ.comap F = ν.comap F` as measures on `α`; pushing forward through
    the measurable embedding `F` (via `MeasurableEmbedding.map_comap`)
    yields the displayed restriction equality on `range F`. -/
