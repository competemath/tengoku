/-! # Equality of measures from equality of Radon–Nikodym derivatives

The theorem `Measure.eq_of_rnDeriv_eq` says that two measures which are both absolutely
continuous with respect to a common reference and whose Radon–Nikodym derivatives against
that reference agree almost everywhere are equal.  This is the "uniqueness" direction of
the Radon–Nikodym theorem, packaged as a term-mode lemma so that it can be applied by
unification rather than by syntactic rewriting — the latter is brittle when the measures
carry heavy dependent-type indexing.

It is a project-independent statement about measures over a generic measurable
space and a candidate Mathlib contribution.

/-- **A measure is determined by its Radon–Nikodym derivative against a fixed reference.**
If [the measure `μ` is absolutely continuous with respect to a σ-finite reference
measure `ρ`](hyp:hμ), [the measure `ν` is likewise absolutely continuous with respect to
`ρ`](hyp:hν), and [their Radon–Nikodym densities `dμ/dρ` and `dν/dρ` agree `ρ`-almost
everywhere](hyp:h), then [`μ` and `ν` are equal as measures](goal).

Stated for application by unification (`exact`/`apply`) instead of rewriting, so
the reference `ρ` is inferred from the supplied absolute-continuity proofs and the
two measures need not be syntactically aligned with any rewrite pattern. -/
