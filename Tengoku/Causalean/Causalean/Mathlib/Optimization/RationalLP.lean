/-! # Exact certificates for rational linear programs

This module proves attainment and strong duality for a finite linear program
whose variables and coefficients are rational.  The proof uses certified
Fourier--Motzkin elimination: primal variables are eliminated while the
objective coordinate is retained, and every generated inequality records its
nonnegative rational combination of the original rows.  The lower endpoint of
the resulting one-dimensional rational polyhedron is rational; elimination
back-substitution gives a rational primal optimizer, while the recorded
combination gives rational nonnegative dual multipliers of the same value.

The standard form minimizes `c ⬝ᵥ x` subject to `A i ⬝ᵥ x ≤ b i`, where `⬝ᵥ` is
Mathlib's `dotProduct`. Variables are unrestricted in sign. Equalities are
represented by pairs of opposite inequalities, while a nonnegativity
restriction `0 ≤ x_j` is the single inequality `-x_j ≤ 0`. Thus this form
faithfully covers arbitrary finite rational LPs.

/-- Given [a number of ordinary coordinates, an augmented rational inequality, a rational
ordinary-variable vector, and a retained rational objective coordinate](hyp:n,r,x,t), the
[inequality-satisfaction condition](goal) holds exactly when the dot product of the ordinary
coefficients and vector plus the objective coefficient times the retained coordinate is no
greater than the right-hand side.

/-- Given [an augmented rational inequality with one more ordinary coordinate](hyp:n,r), the
[tail inequality](goal) removes its first ordinary coefficient while retaining its objective
coefficient and right-hand side.

It drops the first coefficient whatever its value; it is intended for rows whose first coefficient
is already zero, where it removes that variable without changing the inequality. -/
def AugmentedIneq.tail (r : AugmentedIneq (n + 1)) : AugmentedIneq n where
  coeff := Fin.tail r.coeff
  objCoeff := r.objCoeff

/-- Given [two augmented rational inequalities with one more ordinary coordinate](hyp:n,p,q),
the [cancellation inequality](goal) has each remaining coefficient, its objective coefficient,
and its right-hand side equal to the negative first coefficient of the second inequality times
the corresponding quantity of the first, plus the first coefficient of the first inequality
times the corresponding quantity of the second.

The first ordinary-variable coefficients cancel for any two rows. The result is a valid
consequence of the two inequalities when the first row has a positive first coefficient and the
second has a negative one, which is how elimination uses it; no sign condition is imposed here. -/

with positive first coefficient, their cancellation inequality.
