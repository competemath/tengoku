# The linear density tilt and its probability-measure property

For a probability measure `μ` on a measurable space `Z` and a bounded, mean-zero
"score" `s : Z → ℝ`, the **linear density tilt** at strength `h : ℝ` is the
measure

    tiltMeasure μ s h  :=  μ.withDensity (fun y => ENNReal.ofReal (1 + h · s y)).

This file sets up that construction and proves the elementary facts needed for
the second-order Kullback–Leibler expansion in `KLExpansion.lean`:

* `tiltMeasure_absolutelyContinuous` — the tilt is absolutely continuous wrt `μ`;
* `tiltDensity_nonneg` — for `|h| · C ≤ 1` the density `1 + h · s` is `≥ 0`
  everywhere (bounded score `|s| ≤ C`);
* `MeasureTheory.Integrable.of_bound` supplies the bounded-score integrability
  fact used below;
* `integral_tiltDensity` — the density integrates to `1` (mean-zero score);
* `isProbabilityMeasure_tiltMeasure` — hence for small `|h|` the tilt is a
  probability measure.

For differentiability in quadratic mean and local asymptotic normality, see
van der Vaart, *Asymptotic Statistics*, Ch. 7. This file proves only the
elementary one-observation tilt facts used by the local KL expansion.

/-- On a [measurable sample space](hyp:Z), given [a base measure](hyp:μ),
[a real-valued score function](hyp:s), and [a real tilt strength](hyp:h), the
[linear density tilt](goal) is the measure having density `max(1 + h s(z), 0)`
with respect to the base measure.

When `1 + h s` is nonnegative almost everywhere and the score has mean zero,
this is again a probability measure (see `isProbabilityMeasure_tiltMeasure`). -/

(any `withDensity` measure is). -/

/-- For a bounded score `|s y| ≤ C` and tilt strength with `|h| · C ≤ 1`, the tilt
density `1 + h · s y` is nonnegative: `|h · s y| ≤ |h| · C ≤ 1`.

Proof sketch: `|h * s y| = |h| * |s y| ≤ |h| * C ≤ 1`, hence `h * s y ≥ -1`, i.e.
`1 + h * s y ≥ 0`. -/

/-- The tilt density integrates to `1`: `∫ (1 + h · s) dμ = 1 + h · ∫ s = 1` for a
probability measure `μ` and a mean-zero score `s`.

Proof sketch: split `∫ (1 + h · s) = ∫ 1 + h · ∫ s` via `integral_add`
(`s` integrable by hypothesis), then `∫ 1 = 1` (probability measure)
and `∫ s = 0`. -/

/-- **The linear tilt is a probability measure for small `|h|`.** For a probability measure `μ`
and [a measurable score function `s`](hyp:hs_meas) that is [bounded by a constant `C`](hyp:hsC)
(`|s y| ≤ C` for every `y`) and [has mean zero under `μ`](hyp:hs_mean), if [the tilt strength
satisfies `|h| · C ≤ 1`](hyp:hh), then [the linearly tilted measure `tiltMeasure μ s h` is again
a probability measure](goal).

Proof sketch: its total mass is `withDensity f univ = ∫⁻ f dμ`; since the density
`f = ofReal (1 + h · s)` is nonnegative (`tiltDensity_nonneg`) and integrable, this
equals `ENNReal.ofReal (∫ (1 + h · s) dμ) = ENNReal.ofReal 1 = 1`
(`integral_tiltDensity`). -/
