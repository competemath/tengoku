# Sigma-finite support from finite weighted energy

A finite nonnegative integral controls the measure of positive superlevel sets.
Exhausting by these sets gives sigma-finite measure wherever the density is
positive almost everywhere. Applying this fact to the sum of two finite endpoint
energy densities gives sigma-finite support of an endpoint-sum function, even
when the ambient measure space is arbitrary.

/-- [A measurable nonnegative density with finite integral](hyp:g,hg,hfin)
that is [positive almost everywhere on a measurable set](hyp:s,hs,hpos) gives
[sigma-finite measure on that set](goal) for [any ambient measure](hyp:μ).

Use superlevel sets g ≥ ofReal (1/(n+1)), whose measures are finite by
meas_ge_le_lintegral_div. Their union covers s except for a null set; add that
null set to the exhaustion. Do not assume μ is s-finite or globally sigma-finite.
The conclusion must follow from hfin, rather than from a strengthened hpos.

/-- Let [μ be a measure](hyp:μ) and let [two measurable weights w0 and w1](hyp:w0,w1,hw0,hw1) be
[positive and finite μ-almost everywhere](hyp:hw). If [a complex function f, defined up to μ-null
sets, splits as a sum of two pieces whose weighted L² norms under w0 and w1 respectively are
finite](hyp:f,hf), then [μ restricted to the set where f is nonzero is σ-finite](goal).

Apply sigmaFinite_restrict_of_ae_pos_of_lintegral_lt_top to the sum of the two
weighted squared endpoint densities. Its integral is finite by wNorm_sq, and
where f is nonzero at least one endpoint summand is nonzero almost everywhere.
