# Tonelli on sigma-finite support

A jointly measurable nonnegative kernel can be integrated in either order when
one measure is s-finite and the other is sigma-finite on a set containing the
kernel's support. The ambient second measure may be arbitrary. This is a support
restriction wrapper around Mathlib's Tonelli theorem, retaining infinite values.

/-- [A jointly measurable nonnegative kernel](hyp:F,hF) that
[vanishes outside a fixed set in its second variable](hyp:s,hzero) admits
[interchange of its two integrals](goal), for [an s-finite first measure](hyp:ν)
and [a second measure sigma-finite on that set](hyp:μ).

Restrict the second measure to the support set, use Mathlib's Tonelli theorem,
and remove the restriction with setLIntegral_eq_of_support_subset. No global
sigma-finiteness of the second measure is required. -/
