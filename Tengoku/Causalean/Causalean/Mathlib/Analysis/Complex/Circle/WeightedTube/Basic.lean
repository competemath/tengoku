# Geometry and weights for a circular tube

This module supplies a neutral Euclidean-plane model of the unit circle, its inward and outward
sides, and the radial power weight used for local volume calculations. The plane is represented by
complex numbers, which carry the standard two-dimensional Euclidean metric and Lebesgue measure.

/-- The [Euclidean plane](goal) is represented by the complex numbers, equipped with their standard
two-dimensional Euclidean metric and Lebesgue measure. -/

def unitCircle : Set Plane := {z | ‖z‖ = 1}

/-- For [a planar point](hyp:z), its [signed radial offset](goal) is its Euclidean distance from the
origin minus one; it is negative inside the unit circle and positive outside it. -/

is the absolute radial offset raised to the power $κ-2$. On the unit circle itself the offset is
zero, and zero to a negative power is zero by convention, so for exponents below two the weight is
zero there rather than infinite; this affects only a Lebesgue-null set. -/
