# Fixed-basis tensor-polynomial coefficients

Bounded coordinatewise-degree real multivariate polynomials are represented in one fixed
finite monomial basis. Evaluation at a fixed tensor grid determines every coefficient, so a
pointwise polynomial family has continuous coefficients when its grid values are continuous.
This applies to a Jackson family even if each representative was initially chosen separately.

/-- [A parameter-indexed polynomial family](hyp:p), [a coordinatewise degree bound](hyp:hdeg), [continuous evaluations on a fixed tensor grid](hyp:hgrid), and [a coefficient index](hyp:a) give [a continuously varying recovered monomial coefficient](goal).

A degree-bounded polynomial family has continuous coefficients whenever each value on the
fixed integer tensor grid varies continuously with the parameter. The inverse of the finite
tensor Vandermonde evaluation map is linear and continuous.
