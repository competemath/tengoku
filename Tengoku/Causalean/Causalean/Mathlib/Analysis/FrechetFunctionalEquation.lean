# Fréchet's functional equation (degree-one case)

Fréchet-style finite-difference arguments appear in classical proofs of independence
characterization theorems. This file proves the foundational degree-one case: a continuous
function with vanishing second forward difference is affine
(`affine_of_continuous_of_second_diff_zero`).

The argument is classical: a vanishing second difference makes `f` midpoint-affine;
subtracting `f 0` yields an additive function; a continuous additive map of real
vector spaces is `ℝ`-linear (`AddMonoidHom.toRealLinearMap`).

/-- **Fréchet functional equation, degree one.** If [`f` is a continuous function from the reals
into a normed real vector space](hyp:hf) and [its second forward difference vanishes: `f(x+2s) +
f(x) = 2·f(x+s)` for all real `x` and `s`](hyp:h2), then [`f` is affine — there exist vectors `a`
and `b` such that `f(x) = a + x·b` for every real `x`](goal). -/
