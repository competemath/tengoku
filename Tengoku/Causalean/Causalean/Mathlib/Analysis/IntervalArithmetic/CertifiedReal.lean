# Certified real names and width-controlled refinement

This module represents a real quantity by nested rational enclosures together
with a precision rule, which is an arbitrary function whose computability is
not encoded. It turns any positive rational error target into a concrete
interval that still contains the quantity and is no wider than that target.

/-- A certified real name represents [a real number](hyp:value) by [a sequence of rational
interval enclosures indexed by precision](hyp:approx) that is [nested — each successive enclosure
a subinterval of the one before](hyp:nested) — and [always contains the represented
value](hyp:contains), together with [an arbitrary rule, not required to be computable, that
selects a precision level for any requested positive rational error](hyp:modulus) and
[guarantees that the selected enclosure is no wider than that error](hyp:width_modulus). -/

/-- For [a certified real number](hyp:x) and [a requested positive rational tolerance](hyp:ε), [its refinement](goal) is the rational interval returned at the precision selected by that certificate's modulus for the requested tolerance.

Refinement evaluates the certified modulus and returns its rational enclosure. -/

`ε`](hyp:ε), [refining `x` to the precision selected by `ε`'s modulus yields an enclosure
whose width is at most `ε`](goal). -/

A rational number has the constant point interval as a certified real name. -/

/-- For [a certified real number](hyp:x), [its certified negation](goal) denotes the negative of the real number named by the certificate, negates every rational interval enclosure, and retains the same precision-selection rule.

/-- For [two certified real numbers](hyp:x,y), [their certified sum](goal) denotes the sum of their named real numbers, adds their rational interval enclosures at each common precision, and selects a precision sufficient to make each input enclosure no wider than half the requested tolerance.

Adding certified names adds equal-precision interval enclosures and uses
half of the requested tolerance for each input. -/
