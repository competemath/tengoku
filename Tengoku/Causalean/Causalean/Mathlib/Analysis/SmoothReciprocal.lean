# A globally `C¹` reciprocal with a floor near the singularity

The reciprocal `x ↦ x⁻¹` is singular at `0`. `recipC ε` is a modification that agrees with `x⁻¹`
on `x ≥ ε/2` but is smoothly damped to `0` on the neighbourhood of the singularity, so it is
globally `C¹` on all of `ℝ`. This is the reusable core of the "globally `C¹` extension of an
objective that is singular on the boundary of its feasible box" pattern: multiply the singular part
by a `Real.smoothTransition` cutoff that is `1` on the feasible region and `0` past the boundary.

/-- Given [a real cutoff scale $\varepsilon$](hyp:ε) and [a real argument $x$](hyp:x), the
[floored reciprocal](goal) is $x^{-1}$ multiplied by the smooth transition evaluated at
$(x-\varepsilon/4)/(\varepsilon/4)$. This definition applies for every real cutoff scale,
including zero and negative values.

**Floored reciprocal.** The reciprocal `x⁻¹` multiplied by a smooth cutoff that is `1` once
`x` is a definite distance above `0` and `0` near and below `0`. It coincides with `x⁻¹` on
`x ≥ ε/2` (see `recipC_eq_inv`) yet is globally `C¹` (see `recipC_contDiff`). -/
noncomputable def recipC (ε : ℝ) (x : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  Real.smoothTransition ((x - ε / 4) / (ε / 4)) * x⁻¹

/-- On the region `x ≥ ε/2` (with `ε > 0`) the floored reciprocal is exactly `x⁻¹`, because the
smooth cutoff has already saturated to `1` there. -/

/-- The floored reciprocal is globally `Cⁿ` on all of `ℝ`, for EVERY smoothness order `n`: near
the singularity the smooth cutoff vanishes to infinite order, absorbing the blow-up of `x⁻¹`, and
away from the singularity it is a product of `Cⁿ` functions.

The order is arbitrary because both factors are: `Real.smoothTransition` is `C^∞`, and `x⁻¹` is
`C^∞` away from `0`. `recipC_contDiff` (`n = 1`) and `recipC_contDiff_two` (`n = 2`) are the
`fun_prop`-facing specializations. -/
