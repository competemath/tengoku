# Small real-power arithmetic helpers

This file provides reusable arithmetic identities and inequalities for real
powers, logarithms, and square roots, especially for sample-size factors,
negative exponents, and multiplicative windows. The main lemmas identify
reciprocals with real powers
(`inv_eq_rpow_neg_one`), factor `(A / n) ^ p` into an `A` part
and an `n` part (`div_rpow_of_nonneg_of_pos`), bound nonpositive powers of natural casts
(`rpow_natCast_nonpos_le_one`), and rewrite `q⁻¹ * sqrt q` as `q ^ (-1/2)`
(`inv_mul_sqrt_eq_rpow_neg_half`). It also controls logarithmic real-power
expressions when their positive inputs differ by a fixed multiplicative factor.
