# Second directional derivative along an affine line

For `f : E → ℝ` and a direction `d : E`, the restriction of `f` to the line
`s ↦ f (q + s • d)` has first and second derivatives expressible as directional
derivatives of `f` at the moving base point `q + t • d`:

* `deriv_line`      : `deriv (fun s => f (q + s • d)) t = fderiv ℝ f (q + t • d) d`
* `deriv_deriv_line`: `deriv (deriv fun s => f (q + s • d)) t
                        = secondDirDeriv f d (q + t • d)`

where `secondDirDeriv f d q = fderiv ℝ (fun x => fderiv ℝ f x d) q d`. Two consequences
make `secondDirDeriv` usable as a *curvature modulus* over a constraint set:

* `continuous_secondDirDeriv` : it is continuous in the base point (so it is bounded on a
  compact set, giving the `BddAbove` needed for a `ciSup`), and
* `convexOn_deriv2_nonneg` : a convex `C²` function of one variable has nonnegative second
  derivative at interior points (so such a modulus is nonnegative).

Mathlib has `convexOn_of_deriv2_nonneg` (sufficiency) but not the converse used here.

The statements are objective-agnostic: callers supply `ContDiff ℝ 2 f` and read off the
directional curvature. This is the substrate behind the `dirModulus` / `EnvelopeLineC2Data`
discharge for the reciprocal-product variance envelope.

/-- For [a real normed vector space](hyp:E), [a real-valued function on that space](hyp:f), [a
direction vector](hyp:d), and [a base point](hyp:q), the [second directional derivative](goal) is
the directional derivative at the base point, in the given direction, of the function mapping a
point to the directional derivative of the original function in that direction.

For twice continuously differentiable functions this is the Hessian quadratic form evaluated on
the direction twice. -/

restriction at parameter `t` is the second directional derivative of `f` at the moving base
