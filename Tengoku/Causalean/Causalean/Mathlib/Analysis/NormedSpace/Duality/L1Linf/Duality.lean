# Finite-dimensional ℓ¹/ℓ∞ duality — the main identity

Assembles weak duality (`sSup_dual_le_sInf_primal`) and strong duality
(`sInf_primal_le_sSup_dual`) into the min-norm-representation `=` dual-sup
identity for the node-sampling map, plus the squared corollary used downstream.

/-- **Finite-dimensional ℓ¹/ℓ∞ duality.** For [`k + 1` pairwise distinct real interpolation
nodes](hyp:hp) and [a degree bound `β` at most `k`](hyp:hβ), [the least ℓ¹ norm of a weight
vector that reproduces the endpoint contrast `r ↦ r.eval 1 - r.eval 0` of every degree-`≤ β`
polynomial through its node values equals the largest such contrast attained by a degree-`≤ β`
polynomial bounded by `1` at every node](goal).

This is the min-norm-representation `=` dual-sup identity — the ℓ¹/ℓ∞ pairing on
`ℝ^{k+1}` specialised to node-sampling — combining weak duality (representation
identity + triangle inequality) with strong duality (Hahn–Banach extension). -/
theorem l1_repr_eq_sup_dual (hp : Function.Injective p) (hβ : β ≤ k) :
    sInf (primalNormSet p β) = sSup (dualValSet p β) :=
  le_antisymm (sInf_primal_le_sSup_dual hp hβ)
    (sSup_dual_le_sInf_primal (primalNormSet_nonempty hp hβ))

/-- **Squared form.** Under the same hypotheses as `l1_repr_eq_sup_dual` — [`k + 1` pairwise
distinct real interpolation nodes](hyp:hp) and [a degree bound `β` at most `k`](hyp:hβ) — [the
square of the min-norm-representation value equals the square of the dual sup](goal).

This is the shape consumed downstream (the amplification constant is the squared dual sup). -/
theorem l1_repr_sq_eq_sup_dual_sq (hp : Function.Injective p) (hβ : β ≤ k) :
    (sInf (primalNormSet p β)) ^ 2 = (sSup (dualValSet p β)) ^ 2 := by
