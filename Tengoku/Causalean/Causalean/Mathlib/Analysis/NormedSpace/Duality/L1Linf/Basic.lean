# Finite-dimensional ℓ¹/ℓ∞ duality for minimum-norm node representation — definitions

Fix `k + 1` nodes `p : Fin (k+1) → ℝ` and a degree bound `β ≤ k`.  We study the
minimum ℓ¹ norm of a *weight vector* `w : Fin (k+1) → ℝ` that reproduces the
endpoint contrast `r ↦ r.eval 1 - r.eval 0` on every real polynomial `r` of
degree `≤ β`, sampled at the nodes.

The weight `w` reproduces the contrast on all degree-`≤ β` polynomials iff it
solves the **moment system**
`∑ j, w j * (p j) ^ ℓ = (if ℓ = 0 then 0 else 1)` for every `ℓ ≤ β`
(test against monomials `X^ℓ`; the RHS is `1^ℓ - 0^ℓ`).  That system is the set
`MomentSol p β`.

The two extremal quantities are
* the **primal**  `sInf (primalNormSet p β)` — the least achievable `∑ j, |w j|`
  over `w ∈ MomentSol p β`;
* the **dual**    `sSup (dualValSet p β)`   — the largest achievable
  `|r.eval 1 - r.eval 0|` over polynomials `r` of degree `≤ β` bounded by `1` at
  the nodes.

The main theorem `l1_repr_eq_sup_dual` (in `Duality.lean`) is the identity
`sInf (primalNormSet p β) = sSup (dualValSet p β)`: finite-dimensional
ℓ¹/ℓ∞ Hahn–Banach / LP duality specialised to the node-sampling map.

This file only sets up the definitions and the basic well-posedness facts
(nonemptiness / boundedness of the two real sets).  Everything is stated for
*arbitrary* distinct nodes and *arbitrary* `β ≤ k`, so it is reusable and not
gerrymandered to any downstream schedule.

## Standard reference
Finite-dimensional LP duality / ℓ¹–ℓ∞ Hahn–Banach duality (the ℓ¹/ℓ∞ pairing on
`ℝⁿ`); the min-norm-representation `=` dual-sup identity is standard
optimal-recovery / convex-analysis duality.

/-- For [a nonnegative number of nodes minus one](hyp:k), [a collection of real nodes indexed
from zero through that number](hyp:p), and [a nonnegative degree bound](hyp:β), the [moment
system of admissible weight vectors](goal) consists of precisely those real weight vectors whose
weighted power sum at every nonnegative degree no greater than the bound is zero at degree zero
and one at every positive degree.

Equivalently, such a vector reproduces the value at one minus the value at zero of every real
polynomial of degree at most the bound from its values at the nodes. -/

/-- For [a nonnegative number of nodes minus one](hyp:k), [a collection of real nodes indexed
from zero through that number](hyp:p), and [a nonnegative degree bound](hyp:β), the [set of
achievable primal norms](goal) consists of the sums of absolute weights over all weight vectors
that satisfy the corresponding moment system.

Its infimum is the primal minimum-norm representation value. -/

/-- For [a nonnegative number of nodes minus one](hyp:k), [a collection of real nodes indexed
from zero through that number](hyp:p), and [a nonnegative degree bound](hyp:β), the [set of
achievable dual values](goal) consists of the absolute differences between a real polynomial's
values at one and zero, for every polynomial of degree at most the bound whose absolute value at
every node is at most one.

Its supremum is the dual value. -/

/-- **Feasibility of the moment system (Vandermonde).** For [`k + 1` pairwise distinct real
interpolation nodes](hyp:hp) and [a degree bound `β` at most `k`](hyp:hβ), [the moment system —
the set of weight vectors that reproduce the endpoint contrast of every degree-`≤ β` polynomial
through the node values — has a solution](goal).

Equivalently, the moment map `w ↦ (∑ j, w j * (p j)^ℓ)_{ℓ ≤ β}` is surjective, since its
transpose — node-evaluation of degree-`≤ β` polynomials — is injective (a nonzero polynomial of
degree `≤ β ≤ k` has at most `β < k + 1` roots). -/
