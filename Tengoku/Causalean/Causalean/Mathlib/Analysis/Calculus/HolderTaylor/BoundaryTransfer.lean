# Transfer of interior derivative bounds to endpoint within derivatives

Continuity of the within jet on a compact interval carries any common
interior bound to both endpoints. The statement makes no global smoothness
assumption outside the interval.

/-- If all ambient derivatives through order `k` are bounded by the same
constant in the interior of a nondegenerate compact interval, then all
corresponding within derivatives have that bound throughout the closed
interval, including both endpoints.
[The derivative order, interval, bound, function, and regularity assumptions](hyp:k,a,b,B,hab,hB,f,hf,hinterior) yield [the stated closed-interval within-jet bound](goal). -/

  /- On Ioo, the within derivative equals the ambient derivative because
  Icc is a neighborhood of each interior point. `ContDiffOn` and
  `uniqueDiffOn_Icc` make every within jet continuous on Icc. Since Ioo is
  dense in Icc, extend the interior bound with `le_on_closure`. -/
