# Hölder control of a lower within-interval jet

A bound on one more derivative gives a Lipschitz estimate on a compact
interval and hence a Hölder estimate at every exponent up to one.

/-- On an interval of fixed length, a uniform bound on the order-`j+1`
within derivative gives a uniform Hölder-`α` bound on the order-`j` within
derivative. The conclusion includes pairs involving either endpoint.
[The jet order, exponent, interval, bound, function, and regularity assumptions](hyp:j,α,a,d,B,hα,hα1,hd,hB,f,hf,hbound) yield [the stated lower-jet Hölder bound](goal). -/
