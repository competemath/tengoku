# One-face reflection on a cube collar

Reflection weights combine inward samples to define a response on a thin
collar outside one face. This module records the operator, its exact agreement
on the original cube, and the first gluing obligation at the face.

/-- [The left collar](goal) of the normalized cube in [dimension d](hyp:d), for

i-th coordinate ranges over `[-1 - 1/(m+1), 1]` and whose other coordinates
range over `[-1,1]`; it extends the cube outward by 1/(m + 1) past its left face
in coordinate i. -/
