/-- [The cutoff has the stated first derivative](goal) at [every input](hyp:u),
including both glue points.

Express the cutoff as two `joinAt` operations at -1 and 1. The branch
polynomials have matching zero first jets at both junctions. Use
`joinAt (-1) (fun _ => 0) (joinAt 1 (fun v => (1-v^2)^3) (fun _ => 0))`;
its value at -1 is zero, so the closed-half-line convention agrees with cutoff.
The two polynomial derivative helpers above supply the branch derivatives. -/
