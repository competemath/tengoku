# Interior regularity of a one-face reflection

Every inward sample of an open collar point lies in the open cube. Thus the
finite reflection sum inherits all available interior derivatives of the
original response. This is the interior half of the face-gluing argument;
matching the derivatives at the face is a separate obligation.
