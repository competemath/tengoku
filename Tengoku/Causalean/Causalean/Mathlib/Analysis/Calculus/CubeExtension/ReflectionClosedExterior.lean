# Regularity on the closed exterior face slab

The finite reflection sum inherits within-set regularity on the closed
exterior part of a one-face cube collar. This includes its edges and corners,
where ambient derivatives of an arbitrary representative need not exist.

/-- [The closed exterior slab](goal) of the normalized cube's left collar in

/-- If [the reflection weights a sum to one](hyp:ha), so that the reflection
reproduces constants, and [a response u is m times continuously differentiable

left face in coordinate i is m times continuously differentiable within the
closed exterior slab of the left collar](goal), including all exterior edges
and corners. -/

  /- On the slab, each affine inward sample lies in the closed cube, so
  `hu.comp` gives regularity of the finite sum. At the face, all samples
  equal the base point and `ha` identifies the sum with the `else` branch.
  Use `ContDiffOn.congr` to replace the sum by `leftFaceReflection`. -/
