# Extending coordinate derivative bounds to cube faces

Interior estimates for ambient coordinate partials extend to the closed cube
under `C^m` regularity on the cube. The ambient derivative convention is kept:
if a boundary derivative does not exist, Lean's derivative has its default zero
value, which also satisfies a nonnegative bound.

/-- For [a function that is m times continuously differentiable on the closed normalized
cube](hyp:hu) and [a nonnegative bound B](hyp:hB), if [every coordinate partial of order at most m
is at most B in absolute value throughout the open cube](hyp:hinterior), then [the same bound holds
at every point of the closed cube](goal). -/
