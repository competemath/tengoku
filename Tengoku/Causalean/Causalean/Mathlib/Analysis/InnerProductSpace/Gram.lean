/-! # Gram matrices of a kernel

The file defines the Gram matrix `gram k x`, the positive-semidefinite-kernel
predicate `IsPSDkernel`, and the regularized-Gram positive-definiteness theorem
`gram_add_lambda_posDef`: if `k` is positive semidefinite and `λ > 0`, then
`K + λI ≻ 0`.  This is the finite-sample invertibility fact used by kernel ridge
regression.

/-- For [an input space](hyp:X), [a sample size](hyp:n), [a real-valued kernel on that
space](hyp:k), and [a sample of that size](hyp:x), the [Gram matrix](goal) is the matrix whose
row-$i$, column-$j$ entry is the kernel evaluated at the $i$th and $j$th sample points. -/

/-- For [an input space](hyp:X) and [a real-valued kernel on that space](hyp:k), the

its Gram matrix is positive semidefinite. -/

Gram matrix it produces is PSD](hyp:hk) and [the regularization level `lam` is strictly
positive](hyp:hlam), then [the regularized Gram matrix `gram k x + lam·I` is positive
