/-! # Abstract reproducing representers

Mathlib's `RKHS` class describes Hilbert spaces continuously embedded in a
function space and constructs kernel functions under completeness assumptions.
The `HasReproducingRepresenters` proposition here records only the identity
`f x = ⟪f, kₓ⟫` for a supplied evaluation and representer map. It does not
assert that evaluation embeds `H` into a function space. This is the interface
consumed by the representer theorem and the representer-ball Rademacher bound.
