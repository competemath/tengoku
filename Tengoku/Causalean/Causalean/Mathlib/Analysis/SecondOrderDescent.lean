# Second-order descent for one real variable

This module provides the one-dimensional smooth-optimization descent lemma. A real
function whose second derivative is bounded above in a segment's interior lies below the
corresponding quadratic Taylor model, and a negative initial slope gives an explicit
positive decrease at the clipped quadratic-model step.

The statements are objective-agnostic. Callers supply the regularity on `Set.Icc 0 T`
and the interior pointwise second-derivative bound; this file only turns those hypotheses into
the quadratic upper bound and the optimized descent gap.

/-- For [a real curvature bound](hyp:M), [a real slope margin](hyp:c), and [a real available interval length](hyp:T), the [quadratic-model step](goal) is the available interval length when the curvature bound is zero and otherwise the smaller of that length and the slope margin divided by the curvature bound.

This is the step used by the descent-gap lemmas below: with curvature bound `M`, slope
margin `c`, and interval length `T`, it is `T` if `M = 0` and `min T (c / M)` otherwise. -/

/-! ### Quadratic upper bound -/

/-- A twice differentiable real function whose second derivative is bounded above on an
interval's interior is no larger than its tangent at the left endpoint plus the quadratic curvature
allowance.

The formal statement is on `[0, T]`. It assumes twice continuous differentiability on that
closed interval, differentiability at the left endpoint, and a pointwise bound
`deriv (deriv f) ≤ M` throughout the open interval. Mathlib's Taylor theorem with Lagrange
remainder supplies an intermediate point, and the pointwise bound controls the remainder. -/

constant. -/

/-! ### Optimized descent gap -/

/-- **Quadratic-model descent gap.** For a real function `f` on `[0, T]` where [the interval
length `T`](hyp:hT), [the slope margin `c`](hyp:hc), and [the curvature bound `M`](hyp:hMnn) are
all nonnegative, [`f` is twice continuously differentiable on `[0, T]`](hyp:hf), [`f` is
differentiable at `0`](hyp:hf0), [its second derivative is bounded above by `M` throughout the
open interval](hyp:hM), and [its derivative at `0` is at most `−c`](hyp:hslope), then [the clipped
quadratic-model step lies in `[0, T]`, and the resulting decrease `f(0) − f(step)` is at least
`c·step − (M/2)·step²`](goal).

The conclusion exposes both feasibility of the chosen step and the raw quadratic-model
gap. This form is intended for callers that want to keep their own constants visible before
using the simplified closed forms below. -/

/-- With positive curvature, the clipped quadratic-model step gives at least half of the
linear descent term.

The selected step is `min T (c / M)`, so the guaranteed decrease is at least
`(c / 2) * min T (c / M)`. The factor one half is the standard smooth-optimization
constant from optimizing a quadratic upper model. -/

negative initial slope.

/-- In both zero and positive curvature regimes, the clipped quadratic-model step gives a
uniform half-linear decrease.

For zero curvature the sharper endpoint bound is `c * T`; for positive curvature the
selected step is `min T (c / M)`. This theorem packages the common guarantee together with
feasibility of the step. -/
