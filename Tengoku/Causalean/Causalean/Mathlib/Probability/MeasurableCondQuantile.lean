# Measurable conditional quantile selection

This file constructs a measurable conditional quantile from Mathlib's regular conditional
CDF `condCDF ρ : α → StieltjesFunction ℝ`.  Given a measurable target level
`τ : α → ℝ` with `0 < τ a < 1`, the conditional quantile is the generalized inverse
`condQuantile ρ τ a = inf {x | τ a ≤ condCDF ρ a x}`.

The key measurability identity is
`{a | condQuantile ρ τ a ≤ t} = {a | τ a ≤ condCDF ρ a t}`, using monotonicity,
right-continuity, and the `atBot`/`atTop` limits of `condCDF`.  The theorem
`measurable_condQuantile_and_attains` proves that `condQuantile ρ τ` is measurable and,
when every conditional CDF is continuous at its selected quantile, attains the requested level:
`condCDF ρ a (condQuantile ρ τ a) = τ a`.

/-- For any measurable parameter space, [a measure on the product of that
space and the real line](hyp:ρ), [a real-valued target-level function on the parameter space](hyp:τ),
and [a parameter value](hyp:a), the [conditional quantile](goal) is the infimum of the real
response values at which the conditional cumulative distribution function reaches the target
level at that parameter value.

The conditional quantile at level `τ` is the generalized inverse of the conditional CDF,
`q(a) = inf { x : ℝ | τ(a) ≤ condCDF ρ a x }`. -/

/-- **Measurable conditional quantile (selection).** For a measure `ρ` on the product of a
parameter space and the reals, and [a measurable target level function `τ`](hyp:hτ) that is
[everywhere strictly positive](hyp:hτ0) and [everywhere strictly below one](hyp:hτ1), if
[the conditional cumulative distribution function of `ρ` is continuous at the selected
conditional quantile, for every parameter value](hyp:hcont), then [the conditional quantile map
`condQuantile ρ τ` is measurable and attains the target level — the conditional CDF at the
selected quantile equals `τ a` for every `a`](goal).

This is the conditional analogue of an unconditional generalized inverse, with measurability
of the selection in the conditioning variable. -/
