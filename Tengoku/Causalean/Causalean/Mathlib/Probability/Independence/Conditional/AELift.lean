# Almost-everywhere equality lifts under overlap

* `ae_eq_of_ae_eq_restrict_arm` — if two `m`-measurable functions agree on
  `μ.restrict E` and every `m`-measurable set null on `E` is globally null,
  they agree μ-a.e. globally.

The supporting lemmas convert restricted a.e. equality to and from equality of
indicators and propagate indicator vanishing through conditional expectation.

/-! # Almost-Everywhere Lifts Under Overlap

This file proves generic almost-everywhere equality lifting lemmas under an
overlap-style null-set hypothesis.

The exported support lemmas convert between restricted a.e. equality and
indicator equality (`indicator_aeEq_of_aeEq_restrict`,
`aeEq_restrict_of_indicator_aeEq`) and propagate vanishing through conditional
expectation (`condExp_indicator_aeEq_zero`). The main public theorem is
`ae_eq_of_ae_eq_restrict_arm`. -/

/-- **Restricted-set a.e.-equality lift for σ-measurable functions.** For [a
sub-σ-algebra `m`](hyp:m) such that [`m` is coarser than the ambient
σ-algebra](hyp:hm), if [`f` and `g` agree on an `m`-measurable
set](hyp:h_eq_meas), [they agree almost everywhere on the restriction of the measure to a set
`E`](hyp:_h), and [every `m`-measurable set whose intersection with `E` is null is
itself null](hyp:_h_overlap), then
[`f` and `g` agree almost everywhere on the whole space](goal).

Without the null-set transfer hypothesis, the statement is false: `m`-measurable
functions can agree on `E` while differing outside `E` if `E` does not detect all
positive-measure `m`-measurable sets.

The proof applies the hypothesis to the `m`-measurable set where `f` and `g`
differ. -/
