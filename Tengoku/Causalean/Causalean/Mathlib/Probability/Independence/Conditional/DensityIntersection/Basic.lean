# Product coordinates and density factorizations

This module fixes the product ordering and the measurable coordinate maps used by the
positive-density intersection theorem.  It also records the three density-factorization
predicates which express the two premises and the desired conclusion.  The definitions are
measure-theoretic and contain no graph- or paper-specific assumptions.
