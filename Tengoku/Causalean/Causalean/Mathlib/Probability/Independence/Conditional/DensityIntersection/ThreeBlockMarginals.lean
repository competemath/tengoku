# Marginal laws of a three-block product density

This module fixes the canonical three-block coordinates and isolates the Tonelli calculations
identifying every marginal law used by the conditional-independence bridge.  In particular, it
records the laws of the conditioning block, each random block paired with the conditioning block,
and the fully reordered triple.
