# Splicing positive density factorizations

This module isolates the analytic heart of graphoid intersection.  Strict positivity on a product
support lets two factorizations with different conditioning blocks be compared along product
fibres and spliced into the factorization for the union block.

  /- Proof plan: finiteness of `withDensity d` and `ae_lt_top` make `d` finite a.e.; positivity
  makes the premise factors nonzero on almost every product fibre.  Use Tonelli/Fubini to obtain
  simultaneous fibrewise versions of both factorizations, cancel along the `Y` and `V` fibres,
  and construct measurable `(X,Z)` and `(Y,V,Z)` factors from fibre integrals. -/
