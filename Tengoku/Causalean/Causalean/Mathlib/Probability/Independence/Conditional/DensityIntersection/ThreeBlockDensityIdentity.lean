# Three-block density factorization versus the marginal-density identity

For a measurable finite density on a three-block product, a measurable factorization through
the conditioning block is equivalent to the cross-multiplied identity between the joint density,
its conditioning marginal, and its two block-with-conditioning marginals. This is the purely
density-theoretic half of the three-block conditional-independence criterion.
