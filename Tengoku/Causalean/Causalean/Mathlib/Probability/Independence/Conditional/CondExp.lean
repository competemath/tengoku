# Conditional-expectation lemmas under `CondIndepFun`

* `condExp_sup_comap_eq_of_condIndep` — drop-of-conditioning: if `g ⟂ f | m`,
  conditioning `h ∘ g` on `m ⊔ σ(f)` equals conditioning on `m` alone.
* `condExp_mul_of_condIndep` — product factorization: `μ[(u∘f)(v∘g)|m] =ᵐ μ[u∘f|m]·μ[v∘g|m]`.
* `condIndepFun_weak_union_of_prodMk` — weak union via `prodMk`: `W ⟂ (V,A)|m ⟹ W ⟂ V|(m⊔σA)`.
* `condIndepFun_prodMk_of_measurable_left` — extension by an `m`-measurable function.
* `condIndepFun_contraction_of_prodMk` — contraction via a product right side.

Conditional-independence consequences for conditional expectations, developed in two stages. Use these identities to simplify conditional means when the relevant variables are conditionally independent.
