/-! # Integrals Under Independent Variables

This file proves a drop-of-conditioning identity for independent random
variables: integrating a function of one variable over an event determined by
an independent variable factors into the event's measure times the full
integral. -/

/-- **Drop of conditioning.** For [random elements `f` and `g` that are independent](hyp:hfg),
    with [`f` almost-everywhere measurable](hyp:hf_ae) and [`g` almost-everywhere
    measurable](hyp:hg), given [a measurable set `E`](hyp:hE) whose preimage
    [`f ⁻¹' E` is measurable](hyp:hpre), and [a function `h` that is almost-everywhere strongly
    measurable with respect to the pushforward measure of `g`](hyp:hh), then [restricting the
    integral of `h ∘ g` to the event `f ⁻¹' E` equals the measure of that event times the
    unrestricted integral of `h ∘ g`](goal).

    The proof rewrites the set integral as an indicator-weighted integral,
    factors it via `IndepFun.integral_fun_comp_mul_comp`, and evaluates
    `∫ indicator_{f ⁻¹' E} 1` via `integral_indicator_one`. -/
