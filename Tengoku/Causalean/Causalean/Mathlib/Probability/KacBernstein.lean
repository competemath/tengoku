# The Kac–Bernstein theorem (finite-variance case)

This file proves the finite-variance **Kac–Bernstein theorem**: if two independent
real random variables `X` and `Y` (with finite second moments) are such that their
sum `X + Y` and difference `X − Y` are independent, then `X` and `Y` are each
Gaussian. This fixed two-variable sum/difference characterization is an input and
strict special case of the Darmois–Skitovich theorem; arbitrary nonzero coefficients
and the general finite-family result are not formalized here. The result is an analytic
characterization of Gaussian laws.

The proof works at the level of characteristic functions `f = charFun (P.map X)`
and `g = charFun (P.map Y)`:

1. `bernstein_charFun_funeq` — the **functional equation** obtained by computing
   the joint characteristic function of `(X, Y)` two ways (directly, and through
   the independent pair `(X + Y, X − Y)`):
   `f (u+v) · g (u−v) = f u · g u · f v · g (−v)`.
2. `charFun_eventually_ne_zero` — `f` and `g` are nonzero on a neighbourhood of
   `0`, so the logarithmic derivatives `f'/f`, `g'/g` are defined there.
3. `gaussianForm_of_funeq` / `bernstein_charFun_gaussian_nhds_zero` — the
   **analytic core**: working with the logarithmic derivative `h_f = f'/f` (no
   `Complex.log`, hence no branch cuts), differentiate the functional equation
   once in each of `u` and `v` to get `h_f'(u+v) = h_g'(u−v)`; as `(u+v, u−v)`
   ranges over a neighbourhood of `0`, both are one constant, so `h_f` is affine
   and `f` is a Gaussian characteristic function near `0`.
4. A **doubling bootstrap** (the instance `f (2t) = f t ^ 2 · g t · g (−t)` of the
   functional equation) propagates the Gaussian form from a neighbourhood of `0`
   to all of `ℝ`; `Measure.ext_of_charFun` then identifies the law as Gaussian.

The proof is organized into those four steps: a characteristic-function
functional equation, neighbourhood nonvanishing, the local Gaussian-form
argument, and the doubling bootstrap to a global Gaussian law. The supporting
infrastructure comes from Mathlib's `charFun`, differentiability, independent
sum, measure-extensionality, and real Gaussian characteristic-function APIs.

/-- **Functional equation for Bernstein's theorem.**  If `X` and `Y` are
independent and the pair `(X + Y, X − Y)` is independent, then the characteristic
functions `f = charFun (P.map X)` and `g = charFun (P.map Y)` satisfy
`f (u+v) · g (u−v) = f u · g u · f v · g (−v)` for all `u, v`.

This is obtained by evaluating the joint characteristic function of `(X, Y)` at
`(u+v, u−v)` in two ways: directly (using `X ⟂ Y`) it factors as `f (u+v)·g (u−v)`,
and through the independent pair `(X+Y, X−Y)` it factors as `f u·g u · f v·g (−v)`. -/

/-- **Pure analytic core: the Bernstein functional equation forces a Gaussian form.**
Let `f, g : ℝ → ℂ` be functions that are [twice continuously
differentiable](hyp:hf,hg) and [equal to `1` at the origin](hyp:hf0,hg0), and
suppose [they satisfy the Bernstein functional equation
`f (u+v) · g (u−v) = f u · g u · (f v · g (−v))` for all real `u, v`](hyp:hfe).
Then [there is a single constant `c` such that, on a neighbourhood of `0`,
`f t = exp (f'(0)·t + c·t²/2)` and `g t = exp (g'(0)·t + c·t²/2)`, with the same
`c` in both formulas](goal).

This is the genuinely hard analytic step and is pure complex analysis (no
probability).  Proof via logarithmic derivatives, which avoids `Complex.log` and
its branch cuts: `f, g` are nonzero near `0` (continuous, value `1` at `0`), so
`h_f := f'/f` and `h_g := g'/g` are `C¹` near `0`.  Differentiating the functional
equation in `u` and dividing by it gives `h_f(u+v) + h_g(u−v) = h_f(u) + h_g(u)`;
differentiating that in `v` gives `h_f'(u+v) = h_g'(u−v)`.  Since `(u+v, u−v)`
ranges over a neighbourhood of `0` in `ℝ²`, both `h_f'` and `h_g'` equal one
constant `c`, hence `h_f(t) = f'(0) + c·t`; the linear ODE `f' = h_f · f` with
`f 0 = 1` has the claimed exponential as unique solution (verify by differentiating
`f · exp(−(f'(0)·t + c·t²/2))`, which is constant `1`). -/

/-- **Analytic core of Bernstein's theorem.**  Under the Bernstein hypotheses with
finite second moments, the characteristic functions of `X` and `Y` coincide, on a
neighbourhood of `0`, with Gaussian characteristic functions that share one
variance `σ² ≥ 0` (with means `mf`, `mg`).  The shared `σ²` — a consequence of the
single constant `c` from `gaussianForm_of_funeq` — is exactly what the doubling
bootstrap in `bernsteinCharacterization` needs to extend the Gaussian form to all of `ℝ`.

Wiring: `f, g` are `C²` (`charFun_contDiff_two`) and satisfy the functional
equation (`bernstein_charFun_funeq`), so `gaussianForm_of_funeq` gives the local
forms with linear coefficients `f'(0), g'(0)` and shared quadratic constant `c`.
`iteratedDeriv_charFun_zero` identifies `f'(0) = I·E[X]`, `g'(0) = I·E[Y]` and
`c = −Var X = −Var Y`; set `mf = E[X]`, `mg = E[Y]`, `σ² = Var X ≥ 0`
(`variance_nonneg`). -/

/-- **Kac–Bernstein theorem (finite variance).**
Let `X` and `Y` be real random variables that are [independent](hyp:hXY) and
each have [finite second moment](hyp:hX2,hY2). If [their sum `X + Y` and
difference `X − Y` are independent](hyp:hUV), then [both `X` and `Y` have
Gaussian laws](goal).

This is a strict fixed-coefficient special case and an input toward Darmois–Skitovich. The
arbitrary-coefficient and general finite-family Darmois–Skitovich theorems are not proved here. -/
