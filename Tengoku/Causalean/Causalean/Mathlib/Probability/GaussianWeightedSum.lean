/-! # Weighted sums of independent standard Gaussians

A fixed linear combination `∑ i, a i * ξ i` of independent standard Gaussian random
variables has exactly the centred Gaussian law whose variance is `∑ i, (a i)²`.
The main result is `map_weighted_sum_gaussian`. -/

/-- [A weighted sum of independent standard Gaussians with fixed weights has the centred
Gaussian law whose variance is the sum of the squared weights](goal), provided [the
family is mutually independent](hyp:hindep), [each variable is measurable](hyp:hmeas),
and [each has the standard Gaussian law](hyp:hlaw).

The proof peels one summand at a time over a `Finset`: each `a i * ξ i` is
Gaussian with variance `(a i)²` (`gaussianReal_map_const_mul`), and the partial
sum is independent of the new term
(`iIndepFun.indepFun_finset_sum_of_notMem`), so their laws convolve to a
Gaussian with variances adding (`gaussianReal_add_gaussianReal_of_indepFun`). -/
