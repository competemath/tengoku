# The graph push-forward of a product measure is a composition product

If `νₗ` is an s-finite measure on `γ` and `Φ : β × γ → δ` is measurable, then
pushing a product measure `α ⊗ νₗ` forward along the *graph map*
`(o, l) ↦ (o, Φ (o, l))` produces a composition product `α.compProd κ`, where the
disintegration kernel `κ o = νₗ.map (fun l => Φ (o, l))` reads the first
coordinate as a parameter and pushes the `γ`-marginal through the slice of `Φ`.

This is the abstract measure-theoretic core of "exogenous noise plus a structural
mechanism gives an environment-invariant conditional law": the predictor marginal
is `α`, the exogenous-noise law is `νₗ`, the mechanism is `Φ`, and the resulting
conditional law of the response given the predictor is the kernel `κ`.

/-- For [three measurable spaces serving respectively as predictor, exogenous-noise, and response
spaces](hyp:β,γ,δ), [a measure on the exogenous-noise space](hyp:νₗ), and [a mechanism mapping a
predictor--noise pair to a response](hyp:Φ), the [structural-mechanism kernel](goal) assigns to
each predictor value the push-forward of the noise measure through the corresponding slice of the
mechanism.

Built as the deterministic-times-constant product kernel `(Kernel.id ×ₖ Kernel.const β νₗ)` mapped
through `Φ`. -/

/-- The mechanism kernel is Markov when the exogenous-noise law is a probability measure and
the mechanism is measurable.

Declared as a `theorem`, not an `instance`: the measurability hypothesis `hΦ` is an ordinary
explicit argument that typeclass synthesis can never produce, so Lean rejects it as an instance
from v4.33.0 on. Every use site already applies it by name, so this is a registration change
only — the statement is unchanged. -/
