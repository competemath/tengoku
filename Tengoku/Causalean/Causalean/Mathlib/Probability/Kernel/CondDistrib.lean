# Missing Mathlib-style lemmas about `ProbabilityTheory.condDistrib`

Collects general-purpose conditional-distribution lemmas that are not
specific to this project and should plausibly be upstreamed to Mathlib.
All statements here are independent of `Causalean`'s SCM / SWIG
infrastructure.

## Current contents

* `map_compProd_prodMap_left_eq_compProd_comap` — pushforward identity:
  pushing a `compProd μ κ` forward through `(e × id)` (where `e` is a
  measurable equivalence on the first coordinate) gives
  `(μ.map e).compProd (κ.comap e.symm)`.  General-purpose helper.
* `condDistrib_comp_right_measurableEquiv` — if `e : α ≃ᵐ β` is a
  measurable equivalence, then `condDistrib Y (e ∘ X) μ` evaluated at
  `e x` equals `condDistrib Y X μ` evaluated at `x`, almost surely in
  `x` under `μ.map X`.  Follows from uniqueness of disintegration
  (`condDistrib_ae_eq_of_measure_eq_compProd`).
* `measure_eq_bind_marginal_condDistrib` — classical bind-form
  disintegration of a finite product measure.
* `condDistrib_map_comp` — reparameterization of `condDistrib` through a
  pushforward measure.

## Removed (April 2026)

* `exists_condDistrib_kernel_family` — see the note at the bottom of this
  file.  The statement is provable but does not close the
  `backdoorAdjustment` measurability obligation due to an absolute-
  continuity gap; the intended fix is a `Kernel.condKernel`-based
  restructure of `obsCondDistrib` itself, not a Mathlib lemma.

/-! # Conditional-Distribution Transport Lemmas

This file proves general-purpose lemmas for conditional distributions under
measurable equivalences and disintegration through bind form. The statements are
independent of the causal-model infrastructure and serve as Mathlib-adjacent
measure-theoretic support for identification proofs.

The exported results are `map_compProd_prodMap_left_eq_compProd_comap`,
`condDistrib_comp_right_measurableEquiv`,
`measure_eq_bind_marginal_condDistrib`, and `condDistrib_map_comp`. Together
they move regular conditional distributions across measurable equivalences,
package finite-measure disintegration as a bind identity, and compare
conditional distributions before and after pushing the source measure forward. -/

/-- Push-forward invariance of `condDistrib` under a measurable
    equivalence of the conditioning variable.

    If `e : α ≃ᵐ β` is measurable with measurable inverse, the
    conditional distribution of `Y` given `e ∘ X` agrees (a.e. on the
    source distribution of `X`) with the conditional distribution of
    `Y` given `X`, modulo reparameterization by `e`.

    **Proof.** By uniqueness of disintegration (Mathlib's
    `condDistrib_ae_eq_of_measure_eq_compProd`), the kernel
    `(condDistrib Y X μ).comap e.symm` is `μ.map (e ∘ X)`-a.e. equal
    to `condDistrib Y (e ∘ X) μ`.  The compProd identity needed,
    `μ.map ((e ∘ X), Y) = (μ.map (e ∘ X)).compProd (κ.comap e.symm)`,
    follows from `compProd_map_condDistrib` and
    `map_compProd_prodMap_left_eq_compProd_comap` above.  We then
    transport the resulting `(μ.map (e ∘ X))`-a.e. equality back to
    `μ.map X`-a.e. via `ae_of_ae_map` applied to `e`, evaluating both
    sides at points of the form `e x`. -/

/-- **Measure-theoretic chain rule / disintegration (Mathlib gap).**
For [a finite measure `μ` on a product space](hyp:μ), [`μ` equals the composition obtained by
first drawing the second coordinate from its marginal distribution and then drawing the first
coordinate from its regular conditional distribution given that second coordinate](goal).

    This is a classical disintegration identity; upstream Mathlib has
    `ProbabilityTheory.condDistrib` and `Measure.compProd_of_condDistrib`
    fragments but no single-lemma packaging in this `bind`-form.

    Used by the backdoor completeness chain-rule step to decompose
    `(M.fixSet X).obsKernel s` (projected to `ValuesOn (Y ∪ Z)`) into its
    `Z`-marginal bound against its `Y | Z` conditional. -/

-- **Note (April 2026).**  A previous stub `exists_condDistrib_kernel_family`
-- in this file tried to package "there exists a kernel agreeing a.e. with
-- `condDistrib Y X (κ a)` at each `a`" as a Mathlib-style existence lemma.
-- That statement is provable (via `ProbabilityTheory.Kernel.condKernel`
-- applied to the joint push-forward `κ.map ⟨X, Y⟩`, which disintegrates the
-- same joint and hence agrees a.e. by uniqueness of disintegration), but it
-- does **not** close the `backdoorAdjustment` measurability obligation in
-- `SCM/ID/Adjustment.lean`:
--
--   `condDistrib` makes per-measure Radon–Nikodym choices that are not
--   functorial in the source measure, so `s ↦ condDistrib Y X (κ s) b` is
--   not measurable.  A `Kernel.condKernel`-based replacement *is* jointly
--   measurable, but it only agrees with `condDistrib` a.e. under
--   `(κ a).map X`.  The `backdoorAdjustment` body evaluates the conditional
--   at `fillZrW s_post z` with `z` drawn from `(κ s_orig).map Z`; the
--   push-forward through `fillZrW` concentrates the `X`-slot on a fixed
--   value determined by `s_post`, which is generally **not** absolutely
--   continuous w.r.t. `(κ s_orig).map X` (continuous-X SCMs fail this).  So
--   the a.e.-equality cannot be transported to bridge the two definitions.
--
-- The proper fix (queued: `doc/plan.md` under "Technical debt — condDistrib
-- → Kernel.condKernel migration") is to redefine `obsCondDistrib` as a
-- slice of a `Kernel.condKernel` at the definition layer in
-- `Causal/Model/Kernel.lean`, then update Rule 2's statement and proof to
-- work at the `Kernel.condKernel` level directly.

/-- **Reparameterization of `condDistrib` through a pushforward.** For [a measurable map `φ` from
    the sample space `Ω` to `Ω'`](hyp:hφ), [a measurable outcome map `g`](hyp:hg), and [a
    measurable conditioning map `f`](hyp:hf), [the conditional distribution of `g` given `f`,
    computed under the pushforward of `μ` by `φ`, agrees almost everywhere on the `f`-marginal
    with the conditional distribution of the pullbacks `g ∘ φ` given `f ∘ φ`, computed under `μ`
    directly](goal).

    This lets a conditional distribution stated on an image space (e.g. observed
    values, under an observational kernel) be transported to the source space
    (e.g. latent values, under the latent product), where additional structure is
    available.  Proved by uniqueness of disintegration
    (`condDistrib_ae_eq_of_measure_eq_compProd_of_measurable`): the required
    `compProd` identity is `compProd_map_condDistrib` for `g ∘ φ`, `f ∘ φ`,
    transported across `φ` by `Measure.map_map`. -/
