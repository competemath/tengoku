# Scalar Bernoulli divergence bounds

This module records a real Bernoulli KL formula and quadratic bounds used by
selected three-Bernoulli laws. The general coefficient depends on an interior
margin; the symmetric small-perturbation bound reuses the quarter-band result.

/-- The [real Bernoulli KL expression](goal) compares a [success mean](hyp:p)
with a [reference success mean](hyp:q) through its success and failure cells. -/
def bernoulliKL (p q : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  p * Real.log (p / q) + (1 - p) * Real.log ((1 - p) / (1 - q))

/-- [Bernoulli KL is at most the squared difference divided by the squared
interior margin](goal) when [the margin is positive](hyp:hη0),
[below one half](hyp:hηhalf), and [both means lie in the margin band](hyp:hp,hq).

The coefficient `η⁻²` is deliberately conservative: `log u ≤ u - 1` gives
`KL(p‖q) ≤ (p-q)²/(q(1-q))`, and both denominator factors are at least `η`.
