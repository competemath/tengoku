/-! # Absolute continuity of finite product measures

This file provides product-measure Radon--Nikodym factorization and the
absolute-continuity side condition for finite i.i.d. product measures. These
results are independent of statistical divergence constructions and can
therefore be reused by Mathlib-adjacent probability developments.
