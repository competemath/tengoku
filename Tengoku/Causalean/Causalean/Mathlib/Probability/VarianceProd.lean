# Variance decomposition on a product probability space

This file provides the law of total variance in an explicit form for a statistic of two
independent coordinates, using its within-slice variances and slice means.

/-- For independent coordinates with laws `μ` and `ν`, and a real-valued statistic `F` on the
product that is [square-integrable under the product law](hyp:hF), suppose that [almost every
slice of `F` along the first coordinate, at a fixed value of the second coordinate, is
square-integrable](hyp:hsection), that [the map `m` of slice means is square-integrable under
`ν`](hyp:hm), and that [`m` records the correct slice means: the integral of `F` over the first
coordinate at almost every value of the second coordinate equals `m` there](hyp:hmean). Then
[the variance of `F` under the product measure equals the `ν`-average of the within-slice
variances of `F` plus the variance, across the second coordinate, of the slice-mean map
`m`](goal). -/
