# An L² common-limit converging-together theorem for real random variables

This file proves a real-valued, finite-variance **converging-together** result: a sequence of real
random variables that is approximated in `L²` by a triangular family, each row of which converges
in distribution to a common limit law `G`, itself converges in distribution to `G`. It is an
L²/common-limit corollary of the more general metric-space converging-together theorem
(Billingsley, Theorem 3.2), not a formalization of that theorem at its full generality. This is the
diagonal step needed by approximation-based CLTs using this stronger interface.

The proof is the standard characteristic-function ε/3 argument:
* for each frequency `t`, split
  `‖charFun (law S n) t − charFun G t‖ ≤ ‖charFun (law S n) t − charFun (law T m n) t‖
        + ‖charFun (law T m n) t − charFun G t‖`;
* bound the first summand by the approximation bound `norm_charFun_sub_le_L2` plus the iterated
  `L²` control `(H2)`;
* the second summand tends to `0` by the per-row weak convergence `(H1)` (the easy direction of
  Lévy continuity, `tendsto_iff_tendsto_charFun.mp`);
* pick `m` large then `n` large to conclude pointwise `charFun (law S n) t → charFun G t`;
* upgrade pointwise characteristic-function convergence to weak convergence with the `clt`
  package's Lévy continuity theorem
  `MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure.tendsto_iff_tendsto_charFun`.

The `L²` discrepancies are controlled in `ℝ≥0∞` via `Filter.limsup`, which sidesteps the
boundedness side-conditions of the real-valued `limsup`; the squared `L²` integral
`∫ ω, (S n ω − T m n ω)² ∂(μ n)` is wrapped with `ENNReal.ofReal`. This is an
`L²` sufficient condition for the approximation-in-probability hypothesis used by the more
general converging-together theorem.

Everything is stated for a general limit law `G : ProbabilityMeasure ℝ`; `clt_of_l2_approx`
specializes to the standard normal `gaussianReal 0 1`, the shape an m-dependent-approximation CLT
consumes.

/-- Given [a measure on the real line and a proof that it has total mass one](hyp:m,h), the
[bundled real probability law](goal) is that measure regarded as a probability law on the
real line.

Bundle a probability measure on `ℝ` (with an explicit `IsProbabilityMeasure` proof) as a
`ProbabilityMeasure ℝ`.  A thin wrapper around the subtype constructor whose declared return type
keeps the bundled `ProbabilityMeasure` topology in scope (avoiding the raw-subtype unfolding that
breaks `𝓝`). -/

/-- **An L²/common-limit corollary of the converging-together theorem.**
Let $G$ be a limit probability law on the reals, let $(S_n)$ be a sequence of real random
variables, one on each probability space in a sequence, and for every row index $m$ let
$(T_{m,n})_n$ be the $m$-th approximating triangular row of real random variables on the same
spaces, with [every $S_n$ square-integrable](hyp:hS_sq) and [every $T_{m,n}$
square-integrable](hyp:hT_sq). Suppose [for every fixed row $m$ the law of $T_{m,n}$ converges
weakly to $G$ as $n \to \infty$](hyp:H1), and [for every tolerance $\varepsilon > 0$ some row $M$
makes the limit superior over $n$ of $E[(S_n - T_{M,n})^2]$ at most $\varepsilon$, i.e. row $M$
approximates $S_n$ in $L^2$ uniformly enough in the iterated-limsup sense](hyp:H2). Then [the law
of $S_n$ converges weakly to $G$ as $n \to \infty$](goal).

This is a real-valued finite-variance specialization of Billingsley's Theorem 3.2: it uses a common
row limit and an `L²` condition stronger than approximation in probability. It is proved through
characteristic functions, reusing the `clt` package's Lévy continuity theorem.

/-- **Converging-together corollary for the standard normal (the CLT diagonal step).**
The specialization of `tendsto_inDistribution_of_l2_approx` to the standard normal limit law:
let $(S_n)$ be a sequence of real random variables, one on each probability space in a sequence,
and for every row index $m$ let $(T_{m,n})_n$ be the $m$-th approximating triangular row on the
same spaces, with [every $S_n$ square-integrable](hyp:hS_sq) and [every $T_{m,n}$
square-integrable](hyp:hT_sq). If [for every fixed row $m$ the law of $T_{m,n}$ converges weakly
to the standard normal as $n \to \infty$, i.e. row $m$ obeys its own standard-normal central
limit theorem](hyp:H1), and [for every tolerance $\varepsilon > 0$ some row $M$ makes the limit
superior over $n$ of $E[(S_n - T_{M,n})^2]$ at most $\varepsilon$, so row $M$ approximates $S_n$
in $L^2$ in the iterated-limsup sense](hyp:H2), then [the law of $S_n$ converges weakly to the
standard normal as $n \to \infty$](goal).

This is exactly the shape an m-dependent-approximation CLT consumes to pass from the per-`m`
m-dependent CLT to the limit. -/
