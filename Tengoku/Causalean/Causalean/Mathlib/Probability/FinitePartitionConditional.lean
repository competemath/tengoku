# Finite-partition aggregation of conditional probabilities

This module provides the law of total probability over a finite measurable partition, written with
Mathlib's conditional measure `μ[E | C]`, and its uniform-bound consequence: a bound on the
conditional probability of an event in every positive-probability cell bounds its unconditional
probability.  Zero-probability cells are handled explicitly, so applications only need conditional
estimates on positive-probability cells.
