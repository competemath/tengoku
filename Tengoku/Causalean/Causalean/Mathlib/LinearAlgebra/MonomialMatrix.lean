/-! # Generalized-permutation (monomial) matrices

A generalized-permutation (monomial) matrix has exactly one non-zero entry in each row and
column — equivalently, it is a permutation matrix composed with an invertible diagonal rescaling.
These matrices form a group, and this file collects three facts about it.

1. An invertible matrix with at most one non-zero entry per column is automatically of
   generalized-permutation form.
2. A simultaneous row/column permutation of a lower-triangular matrix with non-zero diagonal
   keeps a non-zero diagonal exactly when the two permutations agree.
3. Two unit-diagonal matrices related by a generalized permutation, one of them lower-triangular
   with respect to some ordering of the indices, are equal — triangularity plus a unit diagonal
   forces the permutation to be the identity and every scaling to be one.

The third fact is a rigidity statement: within the generalized-permutation orbit of a matrix,
triangularity with respect to an ordering pins down a unique representative.

/-- For a finite index type `ι` and a commutative ring `K`, and [a square matrix `W` over
`ι × ι` valued in `K` with nonzero determinant](hyp:hW), if [every column of `W` has at most one
non-zero entry](hyp:hcol) (for any two distinct rows `i ≠ k`, at least one of `W i j`, `W k j`
vanishes at column `j`), then [`W` is a generalized permutation matrix: there are a permutation
`τ` of `ι` and non-zero scalings `d` with `W i j = if j = τ i then d i else 0`](goal).
