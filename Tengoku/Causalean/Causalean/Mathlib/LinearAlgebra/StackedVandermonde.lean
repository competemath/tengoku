# Stacked block-Vandermonde injectivity

For distinct nodes, this file constructs concrete block weights for which the stacked
contraction map is injective. The construction separates one coordinate into the first
block and uses Vandermonde independence on the remaining coordinates in the last block.

/-- Given [an element \(z\) of a multiplicative monoid](hyp:z) and [a nonnegative integer
\(k\)](hyp:k), the [affine power vector](goal) is the vector indexed by the integers from zero
through \(k\) whose entry at \(r\) is \(z^r\).

Over a field, this is the coefficient vector of `(X₀ + z X₁)^k` after normalization by the
corresponding nonzero binomial coefficient. -/
def affineBinaryPower {K : Type*} [Monoid K] (z : K) (k : ℕ) : Fin (k + 1) → K :=
  fun r => z ^ (r : ℕ)

/-- Given [a nonnegative integer \(N\)](hyp:N), [\(N+1\) slope values](hyp:slopes),
[a weight assigned to each slope and each of the \(N\) blocks](hyp:weights), and
[a coefficient attached to each slope](hyp:e), the [stacked contraction](goal) maps a block
index \(k<N\) and an exponent \(r\leq k\) to the sum, over all slopes, of the weight times the
coefficient times the \(r\)-th power of that slope.

Over a field in the affine chart `ℓ j = X₀ + slopes j X₁`, its `k`-th component agrees with the
coefficient vector of `∑ j, weights j k * e j • (ℓ j)^k` up to invertible binomial diagonal
rescaling. -/

    (weights : Fin (N + 1) → Fin N → K) (e : Fin (N + 1) → K) :
    (k : Fin N) → Fin (k.1 + 1) → K :=
  fun k r => ∑ j, weights j k * e j * affineBinaryPower (slopes j) k.1 r

/-- Given [a positive integer \(N\)](hyp:N,hN), the [block-Vandermonde witness weights](goal)
assign weight one only to index zero in block zero and to every nonzero index in block \(N-1\),
and assign weight zero in all other cases. [The first block is chosen as block zero](step:1),
the second as block \(N-1\), and the stated case assignment defines the weights.

This is the two-block specialization from the block-Vandermonde argument: `J₀ = {0}` and
`J_{N-1} = {1, …, N}`. -/
def blockVandermondeWitnessWeights {K : Type*} [Zero K] [One K] (N : ℕ) (hN : 1 ≤ N) :
    Fin (N + 1) → Fin N → K :=
  let zeroBlock : Fin N := ⟨0, by omega⟩
  let topBlock : Fin N := ⟨N - 1, Nat.sub_lt (by omega) (by omega)⟩
  fun j k =>
    if j = 0 then
      if k = zeroBlock then 1 else 0
    else if k = topBlock then 1 else 0

/-- For a commutative integral domain `K`, [at least three indices `N + 1`](hyp:hN) (`2 ≤ N`),
and [slope values `slopes : Fin (N + 1) → K`](hyp:slopes) that are
[pairwise distinct](hyp:hslopes),
[there exist weights `Fin (N + 1) → Fin N → K` for which the stacked contraction is
injective](goal). The first block detects coordinate `0`, while the
last block is a square Vandermonde system on coordinates `1,…,N`.

This is an explicit-witness existence result; it does not characterize a generic set of weights. -/
