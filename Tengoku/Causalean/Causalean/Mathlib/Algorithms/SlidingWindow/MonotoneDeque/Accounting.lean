# Trace accounting and mutation-count bounds

Exact event lists make the amortized proof explicit. Each pushed stream index is unique, every pop
is charged to a prior unique push, the final deque contains the unpopped pushes, and therefore all
deque mutations are linear in stream length. Pointwise storage is bounded by window width. These
counts do not model the traversal, reversal, comparison, lookup, or append work performed by the
list implementation, so they are not execution-time bounds.
