# Fixed finite families of monotone-window passes

This module packages an arbitrary finite indexed family of independent schedules over the same
finite stream. It exports per-pass correctness and aggregate mutation-count bounds whose displayed
factor retains the number of passes. These bounds do not assert that the pass count is independent
of stream length or model the runtime of the list implementation.
