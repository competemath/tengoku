/-! ## Hypergraph definitions -/

/-- A finite hypergraph on `V`, encoded by its finite edge family. -/
abbrev Hypergraph (V : Type*) := Finset (Finset V)

/-- A family of hypergraphs indexed by `ι`. -/
abbrev HypergraphFamily (ι : Type*) (V : Type*) := ι → Hypergraph V

/-- The vertex set of a hypergraph given by its edge set: the union of all edges. -/
noncomputable def vertexSet {V : Type*} [DecidableEq V]
    (edges : Hypergraph V) : Finset V :=
  edges.biUnion id

/-- The unique coverage count: the number of vertices belonging to exactly one edge in P. -/
noncomputable def uniqueCoverage {V : Type*} [DecidableEq V]
    (edges : Hypergraph V) (P : Hypergraph V) : ℕ :=
  (vertexSet edges).filter (fun v => (P.filter (fun e => v ∈ e)).card = 1) |>.card

/-- A hypergraph contains no partition of size greater than n. -/
def NoLargePartition {V : Type*} [DecidableEq V]
    (edges : Hypergraph V) (n : ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ P : Hypergraph V, P ⊆ edges → uniqueCoverage edges P ≤ n

/-- `H n` is the largest number of vertices of a finite hypergraph with no isolated
    vertices and no partition of size greater than `n`.

    In this development hypergraphs are encoded by their edge sets, so "no isolated
    vertices" is reflected by taking the vertex set to be the union of the edges. -/
noncomputable def H (n : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  sSup {k : ℕ | ∃ (edges : Hypergraph ℕ),
    (vertexSet edges).card = k ∧ NoLargePartition edges n}

/-! ## The benchmark sequence k_n -/

/-- The benchmark sequence k(n) defined by k(1) = 1 and
    k(n) = ⌊n/2⌋ + k(⌊n/2⌋) + k(⌊(n+1)/2⌋) for n ≥ 2. -/

  | 1 => 1
  | n + 2 =>
    let half := (n + 2) / 2
    let halfUp := (n + 3) / 2
