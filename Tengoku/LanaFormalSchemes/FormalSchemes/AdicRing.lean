# Adic rings

Formal schemes are built by gluing formal spectra of *adic rings*: topological commutative
rings that are linearly topologized by the powers of a distinguished ideal, and are complete
and Hausdorff for that topology. This file records that notion on top of the algebraic
`I`-adic completeness API (`IsAdicComplete`) and the `I`-adic topology API (`IsAdic`) that
already exist in Mathlib, and relates it to the topological notions of completeness and
Hausdorffness.

## Main definitions

* `IsAdicRing I`: `R` carries the `I`-adic topology and is `I`-adically complete, i.e. `I` is
  an *ideal of definition* of `R`.

## Main results

* `isAdicRing_iff_completeSpace_and_t2Space`: for a ring whose topology is the `I`-adic
  topology, being an adic ring with ideal of definition `I` is equivalent to being a complete
  Hausdorff topological ring.
* `instIsAdicRingBotOfDiscreteTopology`: every discrete topological ring is (trivially) adic
  with ideal of definition `⊥`.

/-- `R` is an **adic ring** with ideal of definition `I` if the topology on `R` is the
`I`-adic topology and `R` is `I`-adically complete, i.e. complete and Hausdorff for that
topology. Formal schemes are glued from formal spectra of such rings. -/
