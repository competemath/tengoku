# Truncated distances, and the duplicator's answer on a line

The arithmetic core of the Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé game on linear orders
([Ehrenfeucht 1961][ehrenfeucht1961application];
[Ebbinghaus–Flum 1995][ebbinghaus1995finite], ch. 2): no logic and no game
here, only integers.

The duplicator's invariant on a line is the classical one – corresponding
points are at equal distance, *or* at distance at least `2 ^ n` on both sides,
where `n` is the number of rounds still to play. Written with the truncation
`DescriptiveComplexity.truncAt n` – clamping to `[-2 ^ n, 2 ^ n]` – the two
alternatives, the order between the points and the case of equal points all
become the single equation `truncAt n (x - y) = truncAt n (x' - y')`
(`DescriptiveComplexity.truncAt_eq_iff`), which is what makes the invariant
manageable: one clause instead of four.

The theorem of the file is `DescriptiveComplexity.exists_answer`: from an
invariant with `n + 1` rounds to spare, any point the spoiler picks between
two existing points can be answered so that the invariant holds with `n`
rounds. Its proof is the textbook case analysis – copy the distance to the
left neighbor, or to the right one, or, when both are large, land in the
middle of a gap that the invariant guarantees is twice as large on the other
side – with the halving of the budget appearing exactly there.

/-- The distance truncated at `2 ^ n`: an integer clamped to
`[-2 ^ n, 2 ^ n]`. Two truncated distances are equal exactly when the
distances are equal or both beyond the truncation, on the same side

/-! ### What an equation between truncated distances says -/

/-- Equal truncated distances have the same sign, weakly. -/
theorem le_zero_congr_of_truncAt (h : truncAt n x = truncAt n y) : x ≤ 0 ↔ y ≤ 0 := by
  have hpos := two_pow_pos n
  rcases truncAt_eq_iff.mp h with rfl | ⟨hx, hy⟩ | ⟨hx, hy⟩ <;> constructor <;> intro <;> omega

/-- Equal truncated distances have the same strict sign. -/
theorem lt_zero_congr_of_truncAt (h : truncAt n x = truncAt n y) : x < 0 ↔ y < 0 := by
  have hpos := two_pow_pos n
  rcases truncAt_eq_iff.mp h with rfl | ⟨hx, hy⟩ | ⟨hx, hy⟩ <;> constructor <;> intro <;> omega

/-- Truncation commutes with negation, as an equation between two
distances. -/
theorem neg_congr_of_truncAt (h : truncAt n x = truncAt n y) :
    truncAt n (-x) = truncAt n (-y) := by
  rcases truncAt_eq_iff.mp h with rfl | ⟨hx, hy⟩ | ⟨hx, hy⟩
  · rfl
  · exact truncAt_eq_iff.mpr (Or.inr (Or.inr ⟨by omega, by omega⟩))
  · exact truncAt_eq_iff.mpr (Or.inr (Or.inl ⟨by omega, by omega⟩))

/-- Equal truncated distances are zero together. -/
theorem eq_zero_congr_of_truncAt (h : truncAt n x = truncAt n y) : x = 0 ↔ y = 0 := by
  have hpos := two_pow_pos n
  rcases truncAt_eq_iff.mp h with rfl | ⟨hx, hy⟩ | ⟨hx, hy⟩ <;> constructor <;> intro <;> omega

/-- **Truncating further is coarser**: an equation between distances
truncated at `2 ^ n` survives truncation at any smaller bound. This is how a
round is spent – the budget halves, and the invariant still holds. -/
theorem truncAt_eq_of_le {m : ℕ} (hmn : m ≤ n) (h : truncAt n x = truncAt n y) :
    truncAt m x = truncAt m y := by
  have hmono : (2 : ℤ) ^ m ≤ 2 ^ n := pow_le_pow_right₀ (by norm_num) hmn
  rcases truncAt_eq_iff.mp h with rfl | ⟨hx, hy⟩ | ⟨hx, hy⟩
  · rfl
  · exact truncAt_eq_iff.mpr (Or.inr (Or.inl ⟨le_trans hmono hx, le_trans hmono hy⟩))
  · exact truncAt_eq_iff.mpr (Or.inr (Or.inr ⟨le_trans hx (by omega), le_trans hy (by omega)⟩))

/-- **Shifting both sides by a small amount costs one round**: two distances
equal up to truncation at `2 ^ (n + 1)` stay equal up to truncation at
`2 ^ n` after a common shift of at most `2 ^ n`. This single lemma answers
the spoiler in the two easy cases of
`DescriptiveComplexity.exists_answer` – the shift being the distance from the
new point to the neighbor the duplicator copies. -/
theorem truncAt_sub_shift {s : ℤ} (h : truncAt (n + 1) x = truncAt (n + 1) y)
    (hs₁ : -(2 ^ n) ≤ s) (hs₂ : s ≤ 2 ^ n) : truncAt n (x - s) = truncAt n (y - s) := by
  have hpow : (2 : ℤ) ^ (n + 1) = 2 ^ n * 2 := pow_succ 2 n

/-! ### The duplicator's answer -/

/-- **The duplicator answers on a line.** Two families of integers whose
mutual distances agree up to truncation at `2 ^ (n + 1)`, and a new point `c`
lying between two points of the first family: then there is a point `d`
answering it, whose distances to the second family agree, up to truncation at
`2 ^ n`, with those of `c` to the first.

The three cases are the classical ones: if `c` is one of the existing points,
copy the corresponding one; if `c` is closer than `2 ^ n` to its left or right
neighbor, copy that distance (`DescriptiveComplexity.truncAt_sub_shift`);
and if it is far from both, the gap it sits in is at least `2 ^ (n + 1)` wide,
hence so is the corresponding gap, and there is room to land at exactly
`2 ^ n` from the left neighbor. -/
