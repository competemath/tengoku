# The criterion for 2-satisfiability, abstractly

A 2-CNF over a type `V` of propositional variables is a relation `Cl` on
*literals* (`DescriptiveComplexity.TwoCnf.Lit`, a variable and a sign): `Cl p q` says
that `p ∨ q` is one of its clauses. Unit clauses are the case `q = p`; the empty
clause has no place here and is handled by whoever builds the formula, since it
is unsatisfiable outright.

This file proves the classical criterion ([Aspvall, Plass & Tarjan
1979][aspvall1979linear]) in this abstract setting: over a finite variable type,
the 2-CNF is satisfiable **iff no literal reaches its own negation and back** in
the implication graph, where the clause `p ∨ q` contributes the implications
`¬p → q` and `¬q → p` (`DescriptiveComplexity.TwoCnf.Step`).

Nothing here mentions first-order logic. That is the point: the criterion is
needed twice over, once for CNF structures over `FirstOrder.Language.sat`
(`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.TwoSat.Ptime`, where it puts 2SAT in PTIME) and once
for the atoms of an arbitrary Krom program (where it turns a Krom definition
into a transitive closure), and the two differ only in what plays the part of a
variable.

The proof of the substantial direction builds a satisfying assignment greedily:
a set of literals that is *closed* under reachability and *consistent* (never
containing a literal together with its negation) can always be extended to
decide one more variable, by picking the sign whose literal does not reach its
own negation and adding everything reachable from it. Consistency survives by
contraposition (`DescriptiveComplexity.TwoCnf.reach_neg`), which turns a clash inside
the new part into the forbidden cycle and a clash with the old part into a
variable that was already decided. Deciding every variable in turn gives the
assignment, and closedness makes every clause true.

/-! ### A bad cycle as a single walk

A bad cycle is a *conjunction* of two reachabilities, `p ⇝ ¬p` and `¬p ⇝ p`,
which no single transitive closure can state. Carrying the literal the walk
started from, and a flag recording that its negation has been passed, turns the
pair into one walk: from `(p, p, false)` to `(p, p, true)`. This is what lets a
`DescriptiveComplexity.TCSpec` express unsatisfiability of a 2-CNF, the flag and the
two literals being the finite mode and the two tuples of a node. -/
