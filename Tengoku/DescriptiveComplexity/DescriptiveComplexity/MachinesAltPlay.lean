# One block at a time: collapsing the moves of a player into a single play

The mathematical content of the machine bridge for the polynomial hierarchy.
`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.AltAcc` recurses one *step* at a time, handing
each move to the owner of the current state's block; a `Σₖ` definition, and the
`k`-round game it describes, hands each player *all* of its moves at once. That
the two agree is the content of this file, and it is where the alternation
bound is spent: because a transition never decreases the block index and never
raises it by more than one
(`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.BlocksWellFormed`), the times at which a given
player moves form one contiguous stretch of the run – a **play of the block** –
and the whole stretch may be committed in a single quantifier.

## The two collapses

A play of block `i` from `c` (`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.BlockPlay`) is a
sequence of genuine steps whose configurations are, up to the last one, in
block `i` and not accepting: it stops exactly when the machine accepts or hands
over to block `i + 1`.

* **Existential** (`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.altAcc_iff_exists_play`): a
  configuration of an existential block accepts exactly when *some* play of the
  block ends accepting, or hands a configuration over to block `i + 1` which
  itself accepts with the remaining budget.
* **Universal** (`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.altAcc_iff_forall_play`): a
  configuration of a universal block accepts exactly when *every* play of the
  block is all right – it hands over only accepting configurations, and it can
  never stall inside the block, neither by getting stuck nor by exhausting the
  budget. The second clause is the “a stuck universal state rejects” convention
  of `DescriptiveComplexity.MachinesAlt` in the form the proofs use.

Both statements are equivalences, and both are proved by induction on the
budget with the *play* generalized, so no strategy tree is ever built.
