# From an integer matrix to a 0-1 matrix, modulo `2 ^ L + 1`

The matrix a gadget argument produces has small integer entries, some of
them negative; a 0-1 matrix with the same permanent modulo `2 ^ L + 1` is
its ladder expansion (`DescriptiveComplexity.ladder`) with the **widths**
`DescriptiveComplexity.widths`: an entry `-1` becomes a ladder of `L` levels
of two rungs, i.e., `2 ^ L ≡ -1`, and an entry `k ≥ 0` a ladder whose least
level has `k` rungs and the others one
(`DescriptiveComplexity.bperm_ladder_widths_modEq`). When the permanent is
known to be `4 ^ t * N` with `4 ^ t * N ≤ 2 ^ L`, the count `N` is read off
the permanent of the 0-1 matrix by a remainder and a quotient
(`DescriptiveComplexity.bperm_ladder_widths_div`): the arithmetic the one-call
reduction to #Cycle Cover applies to the answer of its oracle.
