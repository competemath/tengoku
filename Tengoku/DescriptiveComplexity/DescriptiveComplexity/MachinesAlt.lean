# Alternating Turing machines over a universe, without a vocabulary

The semantics half of the machine bridge for the polynomial hierarchy: what it
means for an *alternating* Turing machine, presented as relations on a
universe, to accept. As in `DescriptiveComplexity.Machines` no vocabulary
appears, so the reductions – which build machines rather than read them – can
reason about acceptance without unfolding any `RelMap`.

## The model

`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData` is `DescriptiveComplexity.TMData` together with
one further family of marks, `Blk j q`: the state `q` belongs to the `j`-th
quantifier block. Two conventions fix the game the marks describe.

* **Which player owns a state.** Block `j` is existential when
  `DescriptiveComplexity.blockPol start j` is `true`, that is, when `j` is even
  and `start` is `true` or `j` is odd and `start` is `false`: the polarities
  alternate outwards-in from `start`, exactly as
  `DescriptiveComplexity.altQuant` alternates the quantifiers of a quantified
  Boolean formula. A state marked by a block of the other polarity is
  *universal* (`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.IsUniv`).
* **Blocks mark states, not times.** A variant marking the *time* – the phases
  of the run scheduled in advance – makes the round structure independent of
  the run, and is rejected for exactly that: it clocks the alternation, which
  is half of what the model is supposed to say.
* **A stuck universal state rejects.** A universal configuration accepts when
  every successor accepts *and there is one*
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.AltAcc`). The other convention – vacuous
  universal quantification, so that a stuck universal configuration accepts –
  is equally standard, and this one is chosen because it makes “the machine
  stops without accepting” mean *reject* in every block, which is what a
  reduction needs: a checking phase that fails may then simply run out of
  transitions, whatever the polarity of the block it runs in.

With one block the model is the nondeterministic one: `AltAcc start n c`
unfolds to “some run of at most `n` steps from `c` reaches an accepting
state”, so `DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.AltAccepts` at `k = 1` is
`DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.Accepts`.

## The alternation bound

Nothing above bounds the number of alternations; the bound is
`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.BlocksWellFormed`, folded into the yes-instances
of the decision problem exactly as linearity of the order is: every state
carries exactly one of the `k` marks, a transition raises the block index by
`0` or `1`, and a start state is in block `0`. All three are first-order for a
fixed `k` – the second because it is a condition on a single transition, which
is what makes “at most `k - 1` alternations” checkable by the kernel of a `Σₖ`
definition rather than by an inspection of runs. The last two together make a
run pass through the blocks in succession, starting at the first, which is what
lets it be read as `k` rounds of a game with the right player in each.

## Transport

`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.AltAgree` records that two alternating machines
over different universes correspond along an equivalence, and the lemmas below
transport acceptance along it – all the isomorphism-invariance proof of the
decision problem needs.

conjoined; universally it is assumed – and, in the same breath, required to be
satisfiable by *something*. That extra clause is the “a stuck universal state
rejects” convention of the module docstring, at the level of quantifiers: a
universal player with no legal move loses rather than winning vacuously. -/

namespace ATMData

variable {A : Type} (M : ATMData A)

/-! ### The players -/

/-- The state `q` belongs to a block below `i`. -/
def BlkLt (i : ℕ) (q : A) : Prop := ∃ j, j < i ∧ M.Blk j q

/-- The state `q` is *universal*: it carries the mark of a block whose
polarity is universal, so the moves out of it belong to the universal
player. -/
def IsUniv (start : Bool) (q : A) : Prop := ∃ j, M.Blk j q ∧ blockPol start j = false

/-- No step is available from the configuration `c`: the machine stops there.
Whether that is an acceptance depends only on the state, never on the block –
see the module docstring. -/
def Stuck (c : Config A) : Prop := ∀ c', ¬ M.Step c c'

/-! ### Alternating acceptance -/

/-- **Alternating acceptance within a budget.** `M.AltAcc start n c` says the
configuration `c` accepts with `n` steps to spare: an accepting state accepts
outright, an existential configuration accepts when *some* successor does, and
a universal one when it has a successor and *every* successor accepts.

The budget recurses, so the definition is a Lean-level recursion rather than a
fixed point, and `DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.AltAccepts` cashes it in at the
number of positions – the same unary bound as
`DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.Accepts`. -/
def AltAcc (start : Bool) : ℕ → Config A → Prop
  | 0, c => M.Acc c.state
  | n + 1, c => M.Acc c.state ∨
      (M.IsUniv start c.state ∧ (∃ c', M.Step c c') ∧
        ∀ c', M.Step c c' → AltAcc start n c') ∨
      (¬ M.IsUniv start c.state ∧ ∃ c', M.Step c c' ∧ AltAcc start n c')

/-- **Alternating acceptance**: an initial configuration accepts within as many
steps as there are positions – chosen by the player of block `0`, which is what
`DescriptiveComplexity.guardQ` at the polarity `start` says.

The residual freedom in the initial configuration (a machine may have several
start states, and its input may leave cells to the blank) belongs to the same
player as the first move, since it *is* the first move; at `start = true` this
is the `∃ c₀` of `DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.Accepts`, which the problem
therefore specializes to when every state lies in an existential block. -/
def AltAccepts (start : Bool) : Prop :=
  guardQ start (fun c₀ : Config A => M.IsInit c₀)
    (fun c₀ => M.AltAcc start (Nat.card {p : A // M.Posn p} - 1) c₀)

/-- **The block structure is well formed**, in the style of
`DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.WellFormed`: every state carries exactly one of
the `k` block marks, and every transition either stays in its block or moves to
the next one. The second clause is what bounds the number of alternations by
`k - 1`, and it is a condition on a *single* transition, hence first-order.

The blocks are entered *in order* – a transition may not skip one, and the run
starts in block `0` – so that the phases of a run are the blocks in succession.
Skipping would be harmless for the number of alternations but not for the
reading of the run as `k` rounds of a game: the round of a player would no
longer be the block whose moves it makes, and a run starting above block `0`
would hand the choice of its initial configuration to the wrong player.
Padding a machine that skips is a matter of inserting one state per skipped
block. -/
def BlocksWellFormed (k : ℕ) : Prop :=
  (∀ q, ∃ j, j < k ∧ M.Blk j q ∧ ∀ j', M.Blk j' q → j' = j) ∧
    (∀ τ q q' j j', M.Tr τ → M.Src τ q → M.Dst τ q' → M.Blk j q → M.Blk j' q' →
      j ≤ j' ∧ j' ≤ j + 1) ∧
