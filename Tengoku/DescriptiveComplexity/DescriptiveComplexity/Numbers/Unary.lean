# Unary representation of numbers in finite structures

The unary encoding: a number carried by an instance is the *cardinality of a
marked set* – `Set.ncard` is the decoding function, and no order is needed.
This file provides the shared lemma kit so that problem files do not hand-roll
cardinality reasoning:

* `DescriptiveComplexity.ncard_image_equiv` and its predicate form
  `DescriptiveComplexity.ncard_setOf_equiv`: invariance of the decoded number under
  equivalences (this is what feeds `DecisionProblem.iso_invariant` proofs);
* `DescriptiveComplexity.initSeg` and `DescriptiveComplexity.ncard_initSeg`: the canonical encoding
  of `k ≤ n` as the initial segment of `Fin n`;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.ncard_compl_eq` and
  `DescriptiveComplexity.ncard_compl_le_ncard_compl_iff`: complement cardinality
  (`n - k`) and the resulting *reversal* of comparisons, which is what the
  Vertex Cover ↔ Independent Set reductions run on;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.nonempty_embedding_iff_ncard_le`: comparing decoded numbers is
  comparing sizes – the bridge to the second-order rendering of a threshold,
  where the injection witnessing the comparison is guessed as a relation
  variable (used by the `Σ₁` definition of Clique);
* `DescriptiveComplexity.nonempty_embedding_iff_ncard_le₂` and
  `DescriptiveComplexity.ncard_setOf_equiv₂`: the same, for a threshold carried by a
  marked *binary* relation – the arity-2 form of the representation, which is
  what problems counting arcs rather than vertices need;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.ncard_tagged_eq_sum`: cardinality under tag-disjoint union –
  the tagged framework's *addition*;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.ncard_univ_pi`: cardinality of a product of marked sets over
  the coordinates of a tuple – the tagged framework's *multiplication*.

Unary representation keeps numbers polynomial in the instance size; problems
whose numbers must be exponential (SubsetSum and friends) use the binary
representation of `DescriptiveComplexity.Numbers.Binary` instead.

/-! ### Thresholds on pairs

Problems whose objective counts *arcs* rather than vertices – Feedback Arc Set,
Max Cut – need a threshold that can reach `n²`, which a marked subset of the
universe cannot. The same unary idea one arity up does reach it: the number is
the cardinality of a marked *binary* relation, decoded as the `Set.ncard` of the
corresponding set of pairs. It stays order-free and isomorphism-invariant, and
the whole kit above applies at the type `A × A`; the two lemmas below are just
its curried form. -/

binary relation. -/

  nonempty_embedding_iff_ncard_le (fun p : A × A => P p.1 p.2) fun p : A × A => Q p.1 p.2
