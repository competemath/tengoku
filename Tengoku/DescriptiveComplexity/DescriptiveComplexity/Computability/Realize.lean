# Deciding first-order satisfaction on a finite structure

The first step of the bridge to Mathlib's computability layer: on a *finite*
structure whose relations are decidable and whose equality is decidable,
`FirstOrder.Language.BoundedFormula.Realize` is decidable, by recursion on the
formula – quantifiers going through `Fintype.decidableForallFintype`.

Mathlib has no such instance (`Realize` is a `Prop`-valued recursion, and
Mathlib's model theory never needs to run it), so it is supplied here. It is
the first formal justification of the claim, elsewhere by inspection, that
first-order interpretations are *effective*: everything a reduction of this
library computes is an evaluation of a fixed formula in a finite structure.

The instance is deliberately independent of the rest of the bridge: it
mentions no encoding of structures, and it is useful on its own wherever a
first-order condition has to be checked by `decide`.
