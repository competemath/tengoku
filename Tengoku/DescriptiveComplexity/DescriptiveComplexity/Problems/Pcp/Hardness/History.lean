# Computation histories as dominoes

The combinatorial core of the RE-hardness of `DescriptiveComplexity.PCP`: a
string-rewriting system has a derivation from its start word to the halting
word exactly when a certain list of domino pairs has a match. Nothing here
mentions a structure or a formula – the first-order side reads this file's
`DescriptiveComplexity.Pcp.History.HasMatch` off an instance.

## The system

A rewriting system is a relation `Rule` between words over an alphabet `Γ`;
one step (`DescriptiveComplexity.Pcp.History.Step`) replaces a left-hand side
by a right-hand side somewhere in the word, and
`DescriptiveComplexity.Pcp.History.Derives` is its reflexive-transitive
closure. The question the dominoes answer is whether the start word `C₀`
derives the one-letter word `[halt]`.

## The dominoes, and the two things the construction has to arrange

A match is read left to right as a *queue*: the unmatched overhang is a word,
each domino consumes its top from the front of the overhang and appends its
bottom at the back, and the whole history `⊳C₀#C₁#…#Cₙ#` is spelt out by the
bottom words one configuration ahead of the top words. Two things have to be
arranged for that reading to be forced.

* **The match must start with the start domino.** Every word is *decorated*
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.Pcp.History.starL` puts a `star` before each letter,
  `DescriptiveComplexity.Pcp.History.starR` after each), so every top begins
  with `star` and every bottom begins with a letter that is not `star` –
  except the start domino's, which begins with `star` as well. Since the first
  domino of a match has its two words beginning alike, it can only be that
  one. This is why every right-hand side of a rule is required to be nonempty
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.Pcp.History.Ok`): a domino with an empty bottom
  would escape the argument, and it is exactly the domino the undecorated
  construction needs to close the match. Here the closing domino swallows
  `halt`, the separator and the `dia` in one piece instead, and its bottom is
  the single letter `dia`.
* **The start domino must not reappear.** Its top is the marker `tri`, which
  no other domino writes, so it can never be consumed again.

The alignment is then algebra: `starL` and `starR` are homomorphisms, and
`starL w ++ [star] = star :: starR w` is the half-letter offset that makes the
top and the bottom of a match spell the same word.

last configuration. -/

A match is read as a queue: the overhang is a word `β # γ`, where `β` is what
is left of the configuration being consumed and `γ` what has been written of
the next one, and every domino takes its top off the front of the overhang and
puts its bottom at the back. The invariant below says exactly that the queue
belongs to a history, and each domino preserves it. -/
