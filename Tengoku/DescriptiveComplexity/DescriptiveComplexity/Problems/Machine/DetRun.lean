# Runs of a deterministic machine, unbounded in time

The tool that makes the *converse* half of a space-bounded hardness proof free.

A reduction into `DescriptiveComplexity.DTMAcceptSpace` has to show both that a
yes-instance is accepted and that a no-instance is **not**. The second half is
usually a second induction – an invariant strong enough to rule out every run.
For a deterministic machine it is not needed: the configurations reachable from
one starting point are *linearly ordered* by reachability
(`DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.reach_total`, from Mathlib's
`Relation.ReflTransGen.total_of_right_unique` and
`DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.step_functional`), so it is enough to exhibit *one*
run, of the machine's own choosing, that ends badly.

Concretely, `DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.not_acceptsSpace_of_reaches_dead` says: if
the initial configuration reaches a configuration that is stuck and not
accepting, and if accepting configurations are themselves stuck, then the
machine does not accept. Both side conditions are properties of the transition
table, so a reduction discharges them by inspection of its own program.

The hypothesis is not determinism but
`DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.UniqueFrom`: every configuration reachable from a
given one has at most one successor. That is what a program which **guesses in
one phase** and is deterministic after it has, and it is all the read-off lemmas
need – a reduction into a nondeterministic problem has to read its certificate
off an arbitrary accepting run, and this is what makes that a case analysis on
the guess rather than a second induction. Global determinism is the special case
(`DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.uniqueFrom_of_deterministic`).

Nothing here is about space: the statements hold for any `TMData` whose runs
are read with `Relation.ReflTransGen`.

/-- **Determinism where it is used**: every configuration reachable from `c` has
at most one successor.

This is weaker than `DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.Deterministic` in exactly the
way a *guessing* program needs. A reduction into a nondeterministic problem has
to read its certificate off an arbitrary accepting run, and the way to survive
that is to guess in one phase and be deterministic everywhere after it: the
machine is then not deterministic at all, but it is unique from the
configuration the guess ends at, and every read-off below asks for no more. -/

This is how a program that guesses in one phase pays for the rest of its run.
The property is “the phase is one the guess is not reachable from”; the step
preserves it because the program's phases only go forward, and at those phases
its rules separate. Global determinism is the case where the property is
`True`. -/

/-! ### A machine that never halts

The other way a no-instance is discharged, and the one a machine with no clock
needs: instead of *one* run that ends badly, an unbounded *chain* of runs that
never ends. A halted configuration is reached in a fixed number of steps, so a
chain whose `n`-th link costs at least `n` of them reaches none. -/
