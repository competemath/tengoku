# The simulating machine on a zipper tape

The simulation of `Turing.ToPartrec.step` by
`DescriptiveComplexity.HaltHard.simStep` is proved against a concrete
sequential semantics first: a configuration is a *zipper*
(`DescriptiveComplexity.HaltHard.LCfg`) – the state, the letters left of the
head (nearest first), the letter under the head, and the letters right of the
head (nearest first) – and one step (`DescriptiveComplexity.HaltHard.lstep`)
applies the table and moves, materializing a blank when the head leaves the
recorded region. This keeps every walk argument a plain list induction; the
sibling `Bridge` file identifies runs of `lstep` with derivations of the
rewriting system `DescriptiveComplexity.HaltPcp.MRule` of the drawn machine,
so nothing here mentions words or rules.

Beside the step and its reachability
(`DescriptiveComplexity.HaltHard.Reach`, and the step-counted
`DescriptiveComplexity.HaltHard.stepsTo` the deterministic backward reading
needs), the file provides the two **walk combinators**: a state that passes a
set of letters unchanged in one direction crosses any run of them
(`DescriptiveComplexity.HaltHard.reach_walkR`/`reach_walkL`). Every phase of
the simulation is a chain of these.
