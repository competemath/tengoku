# Explicit slack amplification for the conditional MinKT reduction

The literal fourfold clock identifies the final gap slack with
`log_2(p^4(t + |x| + |y|))`, while the reduction must pay three logarithmic
losses, the SoI additive constant, and the pair compiler. This module defines a
larger final clock whose logarithm pays those terms by construction.

The enlargement remains a finite product of fixed polynomial clocks. Its
polynomial-growth proof is kept separate from the finite loss accounting.
