# The iterated-clock schedule in the conditional MinKT reduction

This definitions layer records the exact clock schedule in Proposition 6.2 of
Hirahara's *Symmetry of Information from Meta-Complexity*. For
`t' = max {t, |x| + |y|}`, the two ordinary estimator queries use source clocks
`p(t')` and `p^3(t')`, symmetry of information is invoked at `p^2(t')`, and the
final conditional gap clock is `p^4(t + |x| + |y|)`.

The logarithmic losses are not hidden in asymptotic notation. `LossBudget`
states exactly what the correction must absorb and what must fit inside the
final logarithmic slack.
