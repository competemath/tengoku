# Globally sampling NW reconstruction coordinates and advice -- definitions

A fixed-width reconstruction trial chooses a hybrid coordinate together with
full seed and output assignments and a candidate bit. Restricting the full
assignments produces the coordinate-dependent outside-seed and later-tail
advice. This realizes Hirahara's random tuple in one finite uniform sample
space without weighting coordinates by their varying advice-space sizes.
