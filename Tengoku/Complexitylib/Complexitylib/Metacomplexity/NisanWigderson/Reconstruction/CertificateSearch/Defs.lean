# Executable NW reconstruction certificate search -- definitions

A reconstruction certificate records a polarity for the statistical test and
one globally sampled coordinate/advice trial. Its quality is checked by exact
finite truth-table agreement. A batch search tries both polarities for every
sampled trial and returns the first certificate meeting the requested
threshold.
