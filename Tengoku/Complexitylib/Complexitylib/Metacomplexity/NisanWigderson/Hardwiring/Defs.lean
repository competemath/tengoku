# Nisan--Wigderson overlap hardwiring -- definitions

Fixing an NW output coordinate turns its block input into a challenge and leaves
all seed coordinates outside that block fixed. A predecessor block can then vary
only through the challenge coordinates lying in the two blocks' intersection.
This module defines that challenge experiment and its canonical hardwiring table.
