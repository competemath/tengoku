# Nisan--Wigderson overlap hardwiring

When one NW block is replaced by a challenge, each predecessor block depends on
only the challenge coordinates in their intersection. Its observed Boolean
value is therefore recoverable from a canonical table with exactly
`2^|S_i ∩ S_j|` entries. Summing these entry counts gives precisely the
predecessor term in the design's overlap cost.
