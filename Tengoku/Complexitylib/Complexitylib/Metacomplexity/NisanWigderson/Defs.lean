# Nisan--Wigderson set systems and generators -- definitions

An `NWDesign m ell d` is an ordered family of `m` injectively enumerated
`ell`-coordinate subsets of a `d`-bit seed. Injective enumerations avoid
cardinality casts when restricting a seed and retain the coordinate order used
by the hard Boolean function.

The exact weak-design resource is recorded as a natural-number overlap cost.
At output coordinate `i`, it is the sum of `2^|S_i ∩ S_j|` over predecessors
`j < i`, plus one unit for every later output coordinate. A separate predicate
bounds this cost uniformly, allowing later analytic estimates to choose their
own integer upper bound.
