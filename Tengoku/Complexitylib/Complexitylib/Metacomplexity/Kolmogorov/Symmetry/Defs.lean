# Time-bounded symmetry of information -- definitions

Hirahara's time-bounded symmetry-of-information hypothesis has the lower-chain
form

`C_cond^{p(t)}(x | y) + C^{p(t)}(y) <= C^t(pair x y) + log p(t)`.

This layer makes the ordinary machine, random-access conditional machine,
canonical pair codec, transformed clock, and loss function explicit.

The hypothesis is only the inequality. Where `C^t(pair x y) = ⊤` (in particular
whenever `t` is too small for the machine to print `pair x y`) it holds
trivially, and for a machine that describes nothing it holds everywhere; the
machines must be constrained separately (by universality or by the other
hypotheses of a theorem) for it to carry content. An earlier version also
demanded `C^t(pair x y) ≠ ⊤` whenever `|x| + |y| ≤ t`; that requirement can
never hold, since `|pair x y| = 2|x| + 2 + |y|` exceeds the number of output
cells a run of `|x| + |y|` steps can write, so it was removed. Finiteness of
the joint complexity is now a hypothesis of the individual lemmas that need it.

It is only the inequality. It holds trivially wherever the right-hand side is
`⊤`, so it constrains nothing for a machine `M` that describes nothing; theorems
