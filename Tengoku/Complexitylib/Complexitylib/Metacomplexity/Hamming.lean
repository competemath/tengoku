# Finite Boolean Hamming geometry

This module supplies the exact finite geometry used by coding-based
metacomplexity and hardness magnification: a metric on Boolean words, exact
binomial sphere and ball counts, and the Hamming packing bound. Absolute and
rational relative distance are connected explicitly. `BooleanCode` then packages
injective finite encodings, exact rate, minimum distance, and exhaustive unique
decoding without asserting an efficient implementation. A finite
Gilbert--Varshamov theorem supplies separated covering codes nonconstructively.
