# Finite statistical tests for binary generators -- definitions

This layer fixes exact finite conventions for the first step of the
Nisan--Wigderson reconstruction used in metacomplexity. A generator maps a
uniform fixed-length Boolean seed to a fixed-length Boolean output. A test's
acceptance probability is measured both under uniform output bits and under
the generator, and its distinguishing advantage is the absolute difference.

The complexity predicates remain relative to an arbitrary deterministic
machine and primitive clock. Universality and efficient computability of a
particular generator are separate hypotheses.
