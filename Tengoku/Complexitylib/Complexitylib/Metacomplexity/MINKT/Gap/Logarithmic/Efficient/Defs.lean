# Efficient threshold search for logarithmic-gap MINKT -- definitions

This module gives the reverse direction of Fact 3.4 an explicit string
algorithm. On a canonical MINKT code `(x,1^t)`, it scans the thresholds
`0,...,t`, remembers the first one accepted by the supplied gap decider, and
returns that threshold in unary.

The loop state is the canonical nested tuple

`(base, counter, found, best)`.

The counter grows by one unary mark per iteration. Once `found` becomes true,
`best` is frozen. The loop runs `t+1` times, so threshold `t` is included.
