# Differential and affine-residual collision bounds for inversion

In characteristic two, every nonzero derivative of inversion has fibres of size
at most four. The existing reciprocal ternary identity proves this directly.
Adding an arbitrary additive map and a constant therefore leaves at most
`q + 4 * (q - 1)` ordered collisions on a field of size `q`.

The differential uniformity of inversion is classical; see Claude Carlet,
"Vectorial Boolean Functions for Cryptography", Section 3.1.7.
