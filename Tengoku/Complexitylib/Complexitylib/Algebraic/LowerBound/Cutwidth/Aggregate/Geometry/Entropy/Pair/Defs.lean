# The entropy cost of an overlapping pair of conjunction features

The extremal four-outcome distribution is `(5/8, 1/8, 1/8, 1/8)`. Costs use
natural logarithms, consistently with `WeightBound`; divide by `Real.log 2`
to obtain bits. The saving compares this joint cost with two quarter-biased
marginal costs, rather than asserting a mutual-information lower bound.
