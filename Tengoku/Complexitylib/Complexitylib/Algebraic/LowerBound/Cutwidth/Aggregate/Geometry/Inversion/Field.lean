# Affine restrictions of inversion in characteristic two

The reciprocal identity on a nondegenerate affine plane excludes affine
restrictions with more than four points. Scaling one additive defect also rules
out every nonzero additive component of inversion over a field larger than four.

The affine-plane obstruction is a special case of the inverse-function sum
identities discussed by Claude Carlet, "On the vector subspaces of F₂ⁿ over which
the multiplicative inverse function sums to zero", Designs, Codes and Cryptography
93 (2025), 1237–1254, https://doi.org/10.1007/s10623-024-01531-6.
