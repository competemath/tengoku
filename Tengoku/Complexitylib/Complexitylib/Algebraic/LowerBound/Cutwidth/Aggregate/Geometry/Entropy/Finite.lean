/-!+# Finite probability weights for message bounds

A normalized weight on messages certifies an upper bound on their average coding
cost. Conditional weights may depend on earlier coordinates, without requiring
independence. The logarithmic counting argument is the finite communication method
of Roychowdhury--Orlitsky--Siu, with explicit probability weights.
