# A common small seed test for all low-order parities

There are at most `A^t` nonempty subsets of at most `t` among `A` coordinates.
If each such test and each of `C` candidates excludes at most an `η` fraction
of seeds, their union excludes at most an `A^t * C * η` fraction. This is
the union-bound step of Chattopadhyay and Liao, *Extractors for Sum of Two
Sources* (2021), Lemma 5.4, before equation (5) is used on good sampler outputs.
`SourceReduction.Leakage` supplies the individual seed bounds from the actual
selected affine correlation breaker after paying the complete leakage reserve.
