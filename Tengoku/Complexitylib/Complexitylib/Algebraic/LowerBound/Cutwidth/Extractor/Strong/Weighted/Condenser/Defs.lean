# Strong condensation of finite weighted sources

The actual joint output retains an independent uniform seed. An ideal
witness supplies a normalized output distribution for each seed, with a
point-mass cap at every seed. Strong condensation bounds the total variation
between these joint distributions while preserving the uniform seed.

The operations are defined for arbitrary real weights. Empty seed types
use the zero-division convention; probability-preservation theorems require
a nonempty seed type explicitly.
