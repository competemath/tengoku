# Finite two-block entropy repair

A point-mass bound on a joint source gives a nearby block source by replacing
small rows with uniform rows of the same mass. This preserves the first
marginal exactly. Conditional caps are stated without division by the row
mass, so they apply to zero-mass rows as well. Row averaging retains the
original joint point-mass cap, allowing the repair to feed later splitting
steps at the same input threshold.

The power-of-two corollary is a finite marginal-preserving version of
Chattopadhyay--Goodman--Liao, Lemma 5.3 of *Affine Extractors for Almost
Logarithmic Entropy*, <https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/075/>,
which attributes the splitting lemma to Goldreich--Wigderson (1997).
The explicit repair and the sharper bound by the mass of the replaced rows
are proved here. This module concerns probability weights; a recursive
extractor and its seed-reuse argument require further results.
