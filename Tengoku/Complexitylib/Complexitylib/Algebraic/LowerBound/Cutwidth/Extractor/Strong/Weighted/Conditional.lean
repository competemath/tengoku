# Conditioning finite sources without discarding zero-mass rows

Every row is normalized, with a uniform completion at null events. Exact
factorization recovers the original joint law. Total variation from a fresh
uniform output equals the average conditional distance, retaining the actual
first marginal. These identities support finite leakage and independence
merging without a pointwise conditional entropy assumption.
