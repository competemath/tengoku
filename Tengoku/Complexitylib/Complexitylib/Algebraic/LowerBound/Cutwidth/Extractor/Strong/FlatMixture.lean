# Decomposing a capped finite source into flat sources

A nonnegative probability vector with every point mass at most `1 / K` is
exactly a normalized nonnegative mixture of uniform `K`-element supports.
The weights are indexed by those supports, so repeated components have
already been combined. The hypotheses imply that the finite ambient type
has at least `K` elements; no separate cardinality assumption is needed.

The proof completes the probability vector to a doubly stochastic matrix
and applies the Birkhoff--von Neumann theorem from Mathlib, formalized by
Bhavik Mehta in `Mathlib.Analysis.Convex.Birkhoff`. This is a finite existence
theorem, without a computational claim for the mixture weights.
