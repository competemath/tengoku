# Finite weighted sources and strong extraction

Real weights describe finite distributions without requiring their atoms
to have equal probability. Normalization and the point-mass cap are separate
predicates. The cap `K * p x ≤ 1` expresses min-entropy at least `log₂ K`
without logarithms or division in conditional-source arguments.

Distance is half the sum of absolute coordinate differences. The weighted
seeded test samples the source according to its weights and an independent
uniform seed, retaining both the seed and output in the test. All finite-sum
operations remain defined on arbitrary real weights; probability theorems
state normalization and nonnegativity explicitly.
