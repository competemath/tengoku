# Repairing the second block while preserving the first marginal

Rows of mass below `K*μ` are replaced by a uniform row of the same mass.
All other rows are retained. If the original point masses are at most `μ`,
the retained rows already satisfy the desired conditional cap. The formula
is total, including zero-mass rows and empty finite second-coordinate types.
