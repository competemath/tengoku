# Conditional finite weights and independent uniform extension

A conditional row divides by its first marginal. Zero-mass rows use the
uniform distribution, so every row of a probability law is normalized when
the second alphabet is nonempty. Uniform extension retains an arbitrary
first-coordinate law and samples a fresh independent second coordinate.
Uniformizing a joint law means keeping its actual first marginal.
