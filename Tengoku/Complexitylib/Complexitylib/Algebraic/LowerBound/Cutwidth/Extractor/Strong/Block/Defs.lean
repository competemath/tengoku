# Finite block sources

A source on `t` blocks is a probability weighting on `Fin t → α`.
For positive `K`, each one-block extension of a prefix has mass at most
the previous prefix's mass divided by `K`. The definition multiplies by
`K` instead of dividing by the previous mass, so it includes prefixes of
mass zero and does not need a positivity convention for conditioning.
The threshold `K = 0` is allowed and imposes no additional restriction.
