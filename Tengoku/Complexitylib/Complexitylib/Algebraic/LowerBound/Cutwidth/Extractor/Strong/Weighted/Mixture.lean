# Statistical distance under finite mixtures

Retaining a finite mixture tag gives exact averaging of component total
variation distances. Forgetting the tag gives the corresponding upper
bound. Uniform retained-seed families therefore have distance equal to
the average of their conditional distances, including empty seed types.

The component weights need not be probability distributions. Only the
mixture coefficients in the distance identities must be nonnegative;
the pushforward and seed-family linearity identities hold for all real
coefficients. These are finite algebraic identities, with no claim about
computing arbitrary real weights.
