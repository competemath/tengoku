# Adding a fresh seed while retaining earlier seeds

The input is a joint weighting of an earlier seed and a current source.
One fresh independent uniform seed is sampled, a deterministic map is
applied, and both seeds are kept in their original order. The definitions
are total on arbitrary real weights, with the existing zero-mass convention
for empty seed types.
