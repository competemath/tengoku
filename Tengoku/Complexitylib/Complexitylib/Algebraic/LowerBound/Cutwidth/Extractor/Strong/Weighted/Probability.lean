# Finite probability weights and statistical distance

Probability weights remain normalized under marginalization and
deterministic maps. Their total variation distance lies in `[0,1]`, obeys
the triangle inequality, and contracts under deterministic maps. For equal
total mass, a distance bound is equivalent to the same bound on every
finite test. These results connect weighted conditional-source arguments
to the existing extractor contracts phrased using tests.
