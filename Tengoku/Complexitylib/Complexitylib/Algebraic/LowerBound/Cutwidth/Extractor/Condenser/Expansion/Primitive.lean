# Primitive interpolation coefficients for condenser expansion

A nonzero interpolating family can be divided by common factors of a supplied
monic modulus until at least one coefficient is nonzero modulo that modulus.
Its degree bounds and vanishing constraints are preserved when the modulus
has no zero at the constrained seeds.

This proves the normalization step in Guruswami, Umans, and Vadhan,
*Unbalanced Expanders and Randomness Extractors from Parvaresh--Vardy Codes*
(2009), Theorem 3.3:
https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/sites/g/files/omnuum4266/files/salil/files/acm2009.pdf.
The no-zero hypothesis holds for irreducible
moduli of degree at least two; degree-one moduli need a separate expansion
argument. This is an algebraic witness proof, not a condenser evaluator.

changing the zero constraints. The resulting family has a coefficient not
divisible by `E`, hence a nonzero coefficient in the quotient by `E`. -/
