# Finite seeded neighbors and test probabilities

The neighbor set retains the seed coordinate. Test probabilities count all
source and seed pairs, including pairs with the same output, before dividing
by the number of pairs. These definitions describe uniform finite sources;
they do not assert anything about arbitrary probability weights.
