# Strong flat lossless condensation from full-neighbor expansion

For a uniform source on `P`, retain one original source point for every
reached output at each seed. If the output alphabet has at least `P.card`
elements, these assignments extend to injections on `P`, separately for
each seed. Thus the ideal output is uniform on `P.card` values conditional
on every seed, and the seed itself is preserved exactly. Full-neighbor
expansion bounds the fraction of changed source and seed pairs and hence
the discrepancy of every seeded output test.

This is the finite support argument underlying Guruswami, Umans, and
Vadhan (2009), Lemma 4.1, with completion inside each seed fiber:
https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/sites/g/files/omnuum4266/files/salil/files/acm2009.pdf.
The witness may depend on the source support and is not an evaluator.
Extending the result to nonuniform sources requires a separate decomposition
into flat sources; no such decomposition is assumed or supplied here.
