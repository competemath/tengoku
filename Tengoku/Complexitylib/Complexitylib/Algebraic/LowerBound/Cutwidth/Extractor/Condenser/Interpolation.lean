# The finite interpolation step for condenser expansion

For any fixed feature values, fewer than `A * K` evaluation constraints admit
a nonzero family of `K` coefficient polynomials, each of degree less than `A`.
In the Guruswami--Umans--Vadhan expansion proof (2009), Section 3.1, the features
are the first `K` base-`h` monomials evaluated at a neighbor tuple. The parameter
`K` is the actual source size, not the maximum `h^m` allowed by the construction.

This theorem proves existence of the interpolating witness by linear algebra.
It is part of the expansion proof, not an algorithm used to evaluate the
condenser. Removing common modulus factors and proving the root-count bound
are separate steps.
