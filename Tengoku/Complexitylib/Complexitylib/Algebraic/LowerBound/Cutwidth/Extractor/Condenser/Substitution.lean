# The substituted interpolation polynomial has bounded degree

After replacing each coordinate by a source power reduced modulo a supplied
monic modulus, the interpolation polynomial has degree below
`A + (E.natDegree - 1) * (h - 1) * m`. Its evaluation is exactly the weighted
sum of feature values constrained by interpolation. These are the degree and
evaluation steps in Guruswami--Umans--Vadhan (2009), Section 3.1.

The modulus need not be irreducible for these statements. The source is any
polynomial: its degree is reduced before the monomials are substituted. The
subsequent root-count proof separately requires the appropriate field and
source-injectivity hypotheses.
