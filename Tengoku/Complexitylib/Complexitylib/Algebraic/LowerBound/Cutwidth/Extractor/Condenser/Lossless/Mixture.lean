# Averaging flat sources and their lossless witnesses

A uniform source on `P` is exactly the uniform mixture of its `K`-element
subsets when `0 < K ≤ P.card`. Double counting proves this identity for
arbitrary finite sums, and therefore for seeded test probabilities with all
source and seed multiplicities retained.

Nonnegative normalized mixtures preserve a common test-discrepancy bound.
Consequently, lossless witnesses for every `K`-subset extend to larger flat
supports as an explicit mixture of witnesses. Each component is uniform on
exactly `K` outputs conditional on each seed; its support may depend on the
component and seed. The mixture keeps the original uniform seed.

These are finite averaging identities. The decomposition of arbitrary
capped weights into flat sources is `exists_flat_mixture_of_capped_weights`
in `Strong.FlatMixture`. Empty seed
types retain the zero convention of `seededTestProb`.
