# Tests of supplied finite mixtures of seeded sources

Each component samples its own finite source type uniformly and uses an
independent uniform seed. The mixture weights choose the component before
sampling either value. Normalization and nonnegativity are hypotheses of
the probability theorems, rather than requirements of the finite sum.
Empty sampling types use the zero convention of `seededTestProb`.
