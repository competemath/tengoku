# Seeded extraction gives sampling from weak sources

For each small output test, fewer than `K` inputs can hit it on more than a
`2ε` fraction of seeds. Consequently any source whose point masses are at most
`1 / L` has failure probability at most `δ` when `K ≤ δ * L`.

This is the extractor-to-sampler argument credited to Zuckerman by
Chattopadhyay and Liao, *Extractors for Sum of Two Sources* (2021), Lemma 3.15:
https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12652. The printed lemma reverses the entropy loss.
Extraction at entropy `k` yields sampling at entropy `k + log₂(1 / δ)`, as
used in their proof of Lemma 3.18. The support budget here expresses that
direction without logarithms or rounding.

The sampler conclusion covers arbitrary finite probability sources. This
module proves the conversion. `Sampler.Amplification` supplies the finite
somewhere-sampler amplification. `SourceReduction.Sampler` applies both to the
actual matched extractor, with the padded `Γ` extractor as the neighbor map.
