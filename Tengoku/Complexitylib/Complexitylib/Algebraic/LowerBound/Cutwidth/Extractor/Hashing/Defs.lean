# Universal finite hash families

Distinct inputs collide on at most a `1 / card Ω` fraction of seeds. The
division-free cardinality condition is meaningful even for empty types;
probability bounds separately require nonempty sampling types. Universality
does not assert independence of the two hash outputs.

This is Definition 2 of Barak, Dodis, Krawczyk, Pereira, Pietrzak, Standaert,
and Yu, *Leftover Hash Lemma, Revisited* (CRYPTO 2011), specialized to exact
universality and arbitrary finite output types.
