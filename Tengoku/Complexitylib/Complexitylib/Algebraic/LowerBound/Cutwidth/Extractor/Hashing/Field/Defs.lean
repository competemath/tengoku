# Linear hashing by field multiplication and additive projection

Multiply the source by a uniformly chosen field element, then apply an
additive projection. Surjectivity of the projection gives the universal
collision bound. In binary coefficient coordinates, projection onto an
initial segment is the multiply-and-truncate construction used in
Guruswami--Umans--Vadhan (2009), Lemma 5.1:
https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~salil/research/PVcondenser-jacm.pdf.
The seed ranges over the entire field, including zero.
