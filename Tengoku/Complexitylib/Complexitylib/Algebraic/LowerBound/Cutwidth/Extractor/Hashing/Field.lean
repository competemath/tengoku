# Universal linear hashing from a finite field

Field multiplication followed by any surjective additive projection is a
universal family, with exact collision fraction reciprocal to the output
cardinality. Every fixed-seed map is additive and sends zero to zero. This
does not assert pairwise independence: all maps agree at the zero input.
The multiply-and-truncate source is credited in `Hashing.Field.Defs`.
