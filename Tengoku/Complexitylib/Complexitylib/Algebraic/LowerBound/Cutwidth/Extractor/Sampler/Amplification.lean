# Amplifying a finite sampler by neighbor coverage

A large set of outer seeds reaches more base seeds than a good input can send
into a test set. Therefore few outer seeds have every candidate in that test.
The bad-input inclusion preserves the sampler's arbitrary source weights and
its failure probability.

This is the finite reduction in Chattopadhyay and Liao,
*Extractors for Sum of Two Sources* (2021), Appendix A, proof of Lemma 3.17:
https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12652. Seeded extraction also gives the needed
coverage by testing the full neighbor image. This permits a constant-error
extractor to supply the neighbor map when its seed count is affordable.

The theorems prove these implications. `SourceReduction.Sampler` instantiates
them with the padded `Γ` extractor as an explicit neighbor map
(`amplifiedMatchedSampler_somewhereSampler`); its evaluator is polynomial-time
(`gammaBlockExtractorRuntime_mem_FP`).
