# Finite neighbor coverage and somewhere sampling

A neighbor map replaces each outer seed by a list of base seeds. Coverage
bounds the union reached by every sufficiently large outer support. A somewhere
sampler fails at an outer seed only when every candidate belongs to the test set.

These are the finite contracts used by Chattopadhyay and Liao,
*Extractors for Sum of Two Sources* (2021), Definition 3.16 and Appendix A.
They do not assert an explicit construction or a polynomial-time evaluator.
