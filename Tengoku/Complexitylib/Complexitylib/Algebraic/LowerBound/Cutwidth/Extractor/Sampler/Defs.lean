# Finite seeded extraction and sampling from weak sources

The sampler tests only small output sets, as in Chattopadhyay and Liao,
*Extractors for Sum of Two Sources* (2021), Definition 3.14. Its source may
have any probability weights with the stated point-mass bound. The seeded
extractor premise only needs uniform sources on finite supports, since the
proof applies it to the full set of bad inputs.

Seed and output types are assumed nonempty by the public conversion theorems.
All counts retain seed multiplicity, including repeated output values.

The discrepancy for every output test is multiplied by the number of source
pairs and output values, so this definition uses no division. -/

min-entropy at least `log₂ L`. The seed is uniform and independent of the source. -/
