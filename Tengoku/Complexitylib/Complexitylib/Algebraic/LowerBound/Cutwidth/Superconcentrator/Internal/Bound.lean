# Lower bounds from the graph-ordering hypothesis

Root the component of a vertex `r` and split it. The split graph is a connected loopless
multigraph of maximum degree three, so the graph-ordering hypothesis gives an ordering whose
prefix cuts are small. If every ordering of the split graph also has a prefix cut with at
least `h` edges, as the cut lemmas show for the split graphs of superconcentrators,
concentrators and hyperconcentrators, then `h ≤ (A + η) (K - n)⁺ + 3 log₂ (2 K) + C` for `K`
kept edges and `n` vertices with a slot (`le_of_orderingBound_split`): the split graph has
`2 K` vertices, and its edges minus vertices are `K - n`. A connected multigraph has at least
its number of vertices minus one edges, so also `n ≤ K + 1`.

If at least `T` vertices have a slot, then `K - n ≤ M - T` for `M` edges. When `T` sources
of in-degree zero have a slot and every vertex has in-degree at most two, the kept edges enter
non-source vertices with a slot, at most two each, which gives `K - n ≤ (V - T) - T`.

Every input of a superconcentrator reaches every output, so all terminals lie in the
component of the first input, all have a slot, and `T = 2 N`.

Numeric lemmas turn these bounds into asymptotic ones: if `Q` is less than
`(D + 1/A - ε) N`, the log term must absorb `(A ε / 2) N`, which fails for large `N`.
