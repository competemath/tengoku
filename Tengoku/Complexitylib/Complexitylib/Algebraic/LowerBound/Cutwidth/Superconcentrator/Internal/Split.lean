# Splitting the vertices of a multigraph into directed paths

Fix a set `K` of kept edges. Every vertex `w` is replaced by a directed path of *slots*, one
for each end at `w` of a kept edge: first the ends of the kept edges entering `w`, then the
ends of those leaving `w`. Each kept edge joins the slot of its tail end to the slot of its
head end, and consecutive slots of a path are joined by a path edge.

Every slot meets at most two path edges and one kept edge, and no edge is a loop. A vertex
with `s > 0` slots contributes `s` vertices and `s - 1` path edges, so the number of edges
minus the number of vertices is the number of kept edges minus the number of vertices with a
slot. A directed walk entering a vertex along a kept edge arrives at an entering slot, and the
path reaches every leaving slot from there, so directed walks lift; a lifted walk stays in
the paths of the vertices of the original walk, so vertex-disjoint walks lift to
vertex-disjoint walks.

Keeping the edges whose tail lies in the undirected component of a vertex `r` makes the split
graph connected. Applied to a superconcentrator whose terminals lie in that component, the
split graph is a superconcentrator, with each input placed at the first slot of its path and
each output at the last.
