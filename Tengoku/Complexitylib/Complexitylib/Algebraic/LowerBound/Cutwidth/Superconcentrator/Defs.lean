# Superconcentrators

Every edge of a `Multigraph V E` is directed from its first endpoint `fst` to its second
endpoint `snd`. A *directed walk* is a list of vertices in which each vertex is joined to the
next by an edge directed towards it.

An `N`-superconcentrator has `N` inputs and `N` outputs, `2 N` distinct vertices in all, such
that for every `k`, every `k` inputs can be joined to every `k` outputs by vertex-disjoint
directed walks. The walks are not required to be paths. Every path is a walk, so a graph that
is a superconcentrator in the usual sense, with paths, is one in this sense, and lower bounds
for this notion apply to it.

/-- `G` is an `N`-superconcentrator with inputs `input` and outputs `output`. The `N` inputs
and the `N` outputs are `2 N` distinct vertices. For all sets `X` of inputs and `Y` of outputs
with the same number of elements, there are pairwise vertex-disjoint directed walks, one from
each input in `X` to some output in `Y`. Disjointness forces distinct walks to end at distinct
outputs, so the walks join `X` to all of `Y`. -/
