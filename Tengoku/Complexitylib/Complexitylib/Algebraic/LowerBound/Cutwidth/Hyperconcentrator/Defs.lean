# Hyperconcentrators

Every edge of a `Multigraph V E` is directed from its first endpoint `fst` to its second
endpoint `snd`, and a directed walk (`Multigraph.IsDirWalk`) is a list of vertices in which each
vertex is joined to the next by an edge directed towards it.

An `N`-hyperconcentrator has `N` inputs and `N` outputs `y₀, …, y_{N-1}`, `2 N` distinct
vertices in all, such that for every `k`, every set of `k` inputs is joined to the first `k`
outputs `y₀, …, y_{k-1}` by vertex-disjoint directed walks. The walks are not required to be
paths, and they may pass through other inputs and outputs. Every path is a walk, so a graph that
is a hyperconcentrator in the usual sense, with paths, is one in this sense, and lower bounds
for this notion apply to it. Every superconcentrator is a hyperconcentrator.

variable {V E : Type} (G : Multigraph V E)

/-- `G` is an `N`-hyperconcentrator with inputs `input` and outputs `output`. The `N` inputs
and the `N` outputs are `2 N` distinct vertices. For every set `X` of inputs there are pairwise
vertex-disjoint directed walks, one from each input `i` in `X` to an output `output (target i)`
among the first `|X|` outputs. Disjointness forces distinct walks to end at distinct outputs,
so the walks join `X` to all of the first `|X|` outputs. -/
