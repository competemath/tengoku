# Finite multigraphs, prefix cuts, and the graph-ordering hypothesis

A `Multigraph V E` records the two endpoints of every edge in `E`. Parallel
edges are distinct elements of `E` and are counted separately. For a vertex
ordering, the *cut after* a vertex is the set of edges with exactly one
endpoint among the vertices up to it; these are exactly the cuts of the lower
sets of the order.

`OrderingBound A η C` is the graph-ordering hypothesis with coefficient `A`:
every connected loopless multigraph of maximum degree three has a vertex
ordering whose prefix cuts have at most `(A + η) (M - N)⁺ + 3 log₂ N + C`
edges, where `N` and `M` are the numbers of vertices and edges. The circuit
lower bound takes this statement as a hypothesis and yields the coefficient
`1 + 1/A`. `Expansion` proves it for `A = 2 p` from a cubic pathwidth bound
with coefficient `p`, and for `A = 2 c` from a cubic cutwidth bound with
coefficient `c`; the Monien–Preis and Fomin–Høie bounds give `A = 1/3`.
