# Choosing the layout parameters

For fixed parameters, a good sample exists once the graph is large enough. As the decay
rate `q` increases to `1/√2`, the kernel correlation `2q/(1+q²)` increases to `2√2/3`,
where `√(1-ρ)/√(1+ρ) = 3 - 2√2`; the truncation error `3 (2q²)^R` vanishes as `R` grows.
A fine threshold grid with small deviations then brings the prefix-cut coefficient within
any positive slack of `(3/π)(3 - 2√2)`.
