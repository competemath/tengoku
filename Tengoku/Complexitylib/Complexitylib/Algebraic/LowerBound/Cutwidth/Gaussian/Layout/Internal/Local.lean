# Locality of the Gaussian scores

The score of a vertex is a Gaussian form in the coordinates of its kernel ball. Hence the
event that a threshold separates the endpoints of an edge depends only on the union of
the endpoint balls, and each such union meets the unions of boundedly many edges. The same
holds for events about a single score.
