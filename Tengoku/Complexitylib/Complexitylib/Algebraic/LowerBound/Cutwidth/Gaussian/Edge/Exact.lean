# Sheppard's crossing bound

A threshold separates two unit Gaussian forms with correlation `ρ` with probability at
most `arccos ρ / π`. At threshold `0` this is Sheppard's formula for the probability that
two correlated Gaussians differ in sign; this file proves the inequality at every
threshold. It sharpens `gaussPi_between_le`, replacing the ratio
`y = ‖β - α‖ / ‖α + β‖` in its bound `(2/π) y` with `arctan y ≤ y`.

* `gaussPi_abs_le_mul_abs`: for independent standard Gaussians `Z₁` and `Z₂`, the event
  `|Z₁| ≤ k |Z₂|` has probability `(2/π) arctan k`.
* `gaussPi_between_le_arctan`: for coefficient vectors of equal norm with nonzero sum, a
  threshold separates the two forms with probability at most
  `(2/π) arctan (‖β - α‖ / ‖α + β‖)`. The forms `form (α + β)` and `form (β - α)` are
  independent, and a crossing forces the first to lie within the absolute value of the
  second around twice the threshold. A centered Gaussian gives a symmetric interval at
  least the mass of any translate, so the threshold may be taken to be zero, leaving the
  planar angle law.
* `two_mul_arctan_tanHalf`: `2 arctan (tanHalf x) = arccos x`.
* `gaussPi_between_le_arccos`: the bound `arccos ρ / π` for unit forms.
