# Gaussian layouts of cubic graphs

Every large simple cubic graph has a vertex ordering whose prefix cuts have at most
`((3/π)(3 - 2√2) + ξ) h` edges, for any slack `ξ > 0`. The coefficient
`(3/π)(3 - 2√2) ≈ 0.16384` is below the `1/6` of the Monien–Preis bisection and
Fomin–Høie pathwidth bounds.

The ordering sorts Gaussian scores `X_v = ⟨â_v, ω⟩`, where `â_v` is the normalized
truncated distance kernel `z ↦ q ^ dist(v, z)` (radius `R`) and `ω` has independent
standard Gaussian coordinates. Adjacent kernel rows have correlation at least
`2q/(1+q²) - 3(2q²)^R` in every graph of maximum degree three
(`Gaussian.sum_unitKernel_mul_ge`), so each threshold separates an edge with probability at
most `(2/π)√((1-ρ)/(1+ρ))` (`Gaussian.gaussPi_between_le`). A threshold grid, the locality
of the kernel, and a second-moment bound (`Gaussian.pi_deviation_le`) control all
prefixes of one sample simultaneously.
The limiting correlation `2√2/3` is that of the Gaussian wave functions on the 3-regular
tree studied by Csóka, Gerencsér, Harangi, and Virág (*Invariant Gaussian processes and
independent sets on regular graphs of large girth*, 2015) and used by Lyons (*Factors of
IID on trees*, 2017) for bisections of random cubic graphs. The truncated kernel and its
correlation bound for every graph of maximum degree three are developed here.
