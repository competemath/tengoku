# Path decompositions of cubic graphs from edge scores

A real score on the edges of a cubic graph lists the edges in nondecreasing order. Bag `k`
of the resulting path decomposition holds the vertices with an incident edge at a position
at most `k` and another at a position at least `k`.

* `indicator_edgeStraddles_le`: a vertex straddling a threshold has at least four ordered
  pairs of distinct incident edges separated by the threshold, so the indicator of
  straddling is at most a quarter of the number of separated pairs.
* `exists_pathDecomposition_subset_edgeScore`: bag `k` lies inside the vertices with an edge
  scoring at most `t` and an edge scoring at least `t`, where `t` is the score of the `k`-th
  edge.
* `exists_pathDecomposition_of_edgeScore`: fix thresholds `a + i δ` for `i ≤ M`. If twice
  the number of edges in each tail is at most `B`, and for each `i < M` the straddling
  vertices of `a + i δ` plus twice the number of edges scoring in `[a + i δ, a + (i + 1) δ)`
  number at most `B`, then every bag has at most `B` vertices.
