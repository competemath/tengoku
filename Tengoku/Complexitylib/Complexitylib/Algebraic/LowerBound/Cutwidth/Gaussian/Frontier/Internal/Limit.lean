# Choosing the edge-score parameters

For fixed parameters, a good sample exists once the cubic graph is large. As the edge
correlation target increases to `2√2/3`, the per-vertex straddling bound
`(3/(2π)) arccos ((1 + 3ρ₀)/4)` decreases to `(3/(2π)) arccos ((1 + 2√2)/4)`; a fine grid with
small deviations brings every bag within any positive slack of that coefficient.
