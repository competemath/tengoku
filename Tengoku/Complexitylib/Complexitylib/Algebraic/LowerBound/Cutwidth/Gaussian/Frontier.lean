# Gaussian edge-score decompositions of cubic graphs

Every large simple cubic graph has a path decomposition whose bags have at most
`((3/(2π)) arccos ((1 + 2√2)/4) + ξ) h` vertices, for every slack `ξ > 0`. The coefficient
`(3/(2π)) arccos ((1 + 2√2)/4) ≈ 0.14035` is well below the `1/6` of the Fomin–Høie bound.

Each edge `uv` receives the Gaussian score `⟨(x_u + x_v)/‖x_u + x_v‖, ω⟩`, where `x` are the
normalized truncated distance-kernel rows of `Gaussian.Layout`; the edges are listed by score,
and a vertex stays in the bags between its first and last edge (`Gaussian.Frontier.Order`).
A vertex therefore occupies the bag at threshold `t` exactly when `t` separates two of its
three edge scores, which happens with probability at most half the summed crossing
probabilities of its edge pairs; by Sheppard's bound (`Gaussian.Edge.Exact`) a pair with
correlation `ρ'` crosses any threshold with probability at most `arccos ρ' / π`. The three edge vectors at a vertex lie within correlation
`√((1 + ρ)/2)` of the vertex row, where `ρ` bounds the kernel correlation of adjacent rows;
since `‖Σ y_e‖ ≥ ⟨Σ y_e, x_v⟩`, their average pairwise correlation is at least `(1 + 3ρ)/4`,
and concavity of `arccos` (`Gaussian.Frontier.Arccos`) bounds the summed angles. With
`ρ → 2√2/3` the per-vertex probability is at most `(3/(2π)) arccos ((1 + 2√2)/4)`, the
coefficient above. A threshold grid and the second-moment bound control every bag of one
sample, as for the cutwidth layout.
