# Band clusters of Gaussian edge scores

The Gaussian edge-score field gives the edge `uv` of a graph the score
`Internal.edgeScore H q R ω s(u, v) = ⟨(x_u + x_v)/‖x_u + x_v‖, ω⟩`, where `x` are the unit
truncated distance-kernel rows (`unitKernel`) with decay rate `q` and radius `R`, and `ω` is a
standard Gaussian vector indexed by the vertices.

The band graph `bandGraph H score c` keeps the edges of `H` whose score lies in the median band
`[-c, c)`. `bigBandEvent H q R c K v` is the event that the band cluster of `v`, the set of
vertices reachable from `v` in the band graph of the Gaussian edge scores, has more than `K`
vertices.

`BandSubcritical q R c` is a percolation hypothesis: the band clusters are subcritical uniformly
over simple cubic graphs. For every `ε > 0` some cluster size `K` makes the expected number of
vertices in band clusters of more than `K` vertices at most `ε h` on every simple cubic graph
with `h` vertices. It is an open hypothesis, not a theorem of this library. Numerically it holds
on the infinite cubic tree for `c < 0.1826`, which appears to be the worst case; the band-jump
path decompositions (`Gaussian.Band`) and the circuit bounds derived from them take it as an
explicit premise.

/-- **Subcritical band clusters** (an open percolation hypothesis). For every `ε > 0` there is
a cluster size `K` such that on every simple cubic graph with `h` vertices, the expected number
of vertices whose band cluster has more than `K` vertices is at most `ε h`. The band cluster of
`v` is its connected component in the graph of the edges whose Gaussian edge score, for the
kernel with decay rate `q` and radius `R`, lies in `[-c, c)`.

This is not proved in this library. It says that band percolation of the Gaussian edge-score
field is subcritical uniformly over cubic graphs. Numerically it holds on the infinite cubic
tree for `c < 0.1826`, which appears to be the worst case. -/
