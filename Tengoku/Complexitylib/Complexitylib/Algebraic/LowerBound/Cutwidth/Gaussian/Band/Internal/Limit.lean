# Choosing the band-jump parameters

The edge-score parameters of `Gaussian.Frontier` bring the per-vertex straddling bound within
any slack of the frontier coefficient. The band-jump decomposition multiplies it by
`exp (-c²/2)`; a long fine grid, small deviations, and a small Markov threshold bring every bag
within any slack of `exp (-c²/2)` times the frontier coefficient, once the subcriticality
hypothesis supplies a cluster size `K` and the graph is large enough that `K` is negligible.

At `c = 4/25` the doubled coefficient is at most `5/18`, because `2 p ≤ 9/32` and
`exp (-8/625) ≤ 80/81`.
