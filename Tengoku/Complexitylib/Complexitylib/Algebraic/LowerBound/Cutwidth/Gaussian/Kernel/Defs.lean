# The truncated distance kernel

For a graph `H`, a ratio `q`, and a radius `R`, the kernel row of a vertex `v`
assigns `q ^ dist(v, z)` to every vertex `z` within extended distance `R` of `v`
and `0` to every other vertex. Unreachable vertices have extended distance `⊤`
and therefore receive `0`. The unit kernel row divides by the Euclidean norm of
the row, which is at least one because the row has value `q ^ 0 = 1` at `v`.

Spheres and balls are measured by extended distance, so an unreachable vertex
lies in no sphere and no ball.
