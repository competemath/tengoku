# Threshold crossings of Gaussian forms

Three probability bounds for linear forms in independent standard Gaussians.

* `gaussPi_between_le`: for coefficient vectors `α` and `β` of equal norm,
  a threshold separates `form α` and `form β` with probability at most
  `(2/π) ‖β - α‖ / ‖α + β‖`. The forms `form (α + β)` and `form (β - α)` are
  independent Gaussians, and the crossing forces the first to lie within the
  absolute value of the second around twice the threshold. The bound
  multiplies the peak density of the first by the mean absolute value of the
  second.
* `gaussPi_window_le`: a unit form lands in a half-open window of width `δ`
  with probability at most `δ / √(2π)`, the peak density times the width.
* `gaussPi_tail_le`: Chebyshev's tail bound `1 / T²` for a unit form.
