# Band-jump decompositions of cubic graphs (conditional)

Assume the band clusters of the Gaussian edge-score field are subcritical
(`BandSubcritical`, an open percolation hypothesis). Then for every `c > 0` and every slack
`ξ > 0`, every large simple cubic graph on `h` vertices has a path decomposition whose bags
have at most `(exp (-c²/2) p + ξ) h + 1` vertices, where
`p = (3/(2π)) arccos ((1 + 2√2)/4)` is the frontier coefficient of `Gaussian.Frontier`.

The decomposition is the band-jump order of `Gaussian.Band.Order` for the edge scores of one
Gaussian sample, with the band clusters as blocks. Outside the band `[-c, c)` a vertex
straddles a threshold `t` with probability at most `exp (-t²/2) p` by the threshold-decay
crossing bound (`Gaussian.Edge.Decay`), and `|t| ≥ c` there; a grid on each side and the
second-moment bound control every threshold of one sample. Inside the band a bag also holds
the vertices of one block. Such a block lies in one band cluster, which either has at most
`K` vertices or consists of vertices in clusters of more than `K` vertices; by the hypothesis
and Markov's inequality the latter number at most `2 η h` for some sample. Taking `K`
negligible against `h` gives the coefficient.

At `c = 4/25` the doubled coefficient is at most `5/18`, the graph-ordering coefficient of
the circuit bound `23/5`.
