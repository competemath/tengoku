# Path decompositions and the cubic pathwidth bound

A path decomposition of a simple graph is a sequence of bags covering every
vertex and every edge, in which the bags containing a fixed vertex are
consecutive. Its width is one less than the largest bag.

`PathwidthBound p ξ N₀` states a pathwidth bound with coefficient `p` for
cubic graphs: every simple 3-regular graph on more than `N₀` vertices has a
path decomposition of width at most `(p + ξ) h`, where `h` is the number of
vertices. Together with the compression and median-ordering arguments it
yields the graph-ordering hypothesis `Multigraph.OrderingBound (2 p)`.
`PathDecomposition.Bisection` proves the bound with `p = 1/6` from a cubic
bisection bound, and `Bisection.Helpful` supplies the sharp bound for every
positive slack.

The cut of a vertex set in a simple graph, `SimpleGraph.cutFinset`, is the set
of edges with exactly one endpoint in the set. `CutwidthBound c ξ N₀` states a
cutwidth bound with coefficient `c` for cubic graphs: every simple 3-regular
graph on more than `N₀` vertices has a vertex ordering all of whose prefix
cuts have at most `(c + ξ) h` edges. It yields `Multigraph.OrderingBound (2 c)`
by ordering the cubic core with the key itself instead of a median ordering.
