# Concentrators

Every edge of a `Multigraph V E` is directed from its first endpoint `fst` to its second
endpoint `snd`, and a directed walk (`Multigraph.IsDirWalk`) is a list of vertices in which each
vertex is joined to the next by an edge directed towards it.

An `(n, m)`-concentrator (Pinsker, 1973) has `n` inputs and `m` outputs, `n + m` distinct
vertices in all, such that every set `X` of at most `m` inputs is joined to some `|X|` outputs
by vertex-disjoint directed walks, one from each input of `X`. The outputs are not prescribed.
The walks are not required to be paths, and they may pass through other inputs and outputs.
Every path is a walk, so a graph that is a concentrator in the usual sense, with paths, is one
in this sense, and lower bounds for this notion apply to it.

A multigraph is *acyclic* (`Multigraph.Acyclic`) when its vertices can be numbered so that every
edge leads from a lower to a higher number: a topological order. For finite multigraphs this
holds exactly when there is no directed cycle.

/-- `G` is an `(n, m)`-concentrator with inputs `input` and outputs `output`. The `n` inputs and
the `m` outputs are `n + m` distinct vertices. For every set `X` of at most `m` inputs there are
pairwise vertex-disjoint directed walks, one from each input `i` in `X` to some output
`output (target i)`. Disjointness forces distinct walks to end at distinct outputs, so the walks
join `X` to `|X|` outputs. -/
