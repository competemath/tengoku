# Locating a tree component for the endpoint induction

Fomin and Høie's Lemma 4, Case 3.A, uses the elementary fact that a finite
graph with fewer edges than vertices has a connected component that is a
tree. The component includes isolated vertices as one-vertex trees.
If every vertex of a prescribed boundary has at least two neighbors outside
it and the boundary has more than one third of the vertices, degree counting
produces the required edge deficit in its complement.

The quantitative version also bounds the size of a tree component in terms
of the edge deficit. It supports the small-component analysis in Monien
and Preis's red/black graph argument.
