# Joining the two boundaries of a graph cut

The boundary transition in Fomin and Høie's *Pathwidth of cubic graphs and
exact algorithms* (2006), Theorem 5, has width at most the number of crossing
edges. This finite lemma does not require a degree bound. It is one part of
the pathwidth proof, completed in `Bisection` from the still unproved
sharp cubic bisection theorem.

/-- If every vertex has a neighbor across a cut, there is a path decomposition
starting with one side and ending with the other, of width at most the cut size.
Edges within either side are covered by its endpoint bag. -/
