# A family of regions with compensating red attachments

The cycle-removal step of Monien and Preis's argument isolates thin paths.
For restoration, the relevant data are disjoint regions with at most two
black boundary edges, each joined by a red edge to an attached set with
empty black cut. Attached sets can overlap one another, but are disjoint
from all regions. No path ordering or cycle choice is needed for the
simultaneous restoration theorem.
