# Complete boundary normalization with a uniform reverse bound

This completes the second phase of Monien and Preis's normalization:
eliminating interior vertices with three boundary neighbors. Starting
with an independent boundary, it gives either a helpful set of at most
55 vertices or a normalized graph whose moved sets transfer back with
at most a factor-five size increase and no loss of helpfulness.

The original three-neighbor stars are disjoint once small helpful sets
are excluded. A switch processes one fresh center. In reverse order,
give a selected boundary vertex of each still-processed star four credits
and its selected center one. Restoring that star spends its own credits,
adds at most four vertices, and selects no earlier center. This potential
telescopes to the factor-five bound independently of the sequence length.

Combining with `BoundaryNormalization` completes both phases for any cubic
graph: either there is a helpful set of at most 165 vertices, or all moved
sets in a normalized graph transfer back with a factor-fifteen bound.
The connected-cluster proof in `Helpful` needs only the first phase;
this stronger normalization remains available for the thin-path arguments.
