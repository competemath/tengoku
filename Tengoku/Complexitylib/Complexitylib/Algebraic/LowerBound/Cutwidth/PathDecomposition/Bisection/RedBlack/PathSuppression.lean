# Suppressing path vertices in forests

Suppressing an independent family of vertices preserves reachability
between all surviving vertices. If the original graph is a forest and
every removed vertex has degree at most two, the result is again a forest.
Thus a tree remains a tree whenever at least one vertex survives.
Isolated vertices and leaves are allowed among the removed vertices.
If the surviving vertices are independent as well, the removed degree-two
vertices correspond bijectively to the surviving edges.
