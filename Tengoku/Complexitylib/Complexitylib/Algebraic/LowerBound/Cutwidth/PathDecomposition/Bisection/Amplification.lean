# From bounded helpful sets to a prescribed cut reduction

This is the accumulation step in Monien and Preis's cubic bisection proof.
It assumes the local helpful-set lemma and proves the iteration, size bound,
and preservation of the density condition. It does not establish the local
helpful-set lemma itself.

/-- If every remaining side of density above `a` has a helpful set of size
at most `M`, a margin of `k` yields a union of at most `k M` vertices whose
helpfulness is at least `k`. The last move may exceed the target reduction. -/
