# The graph on the core pieces

Identify the region vertices of the region-boundary quotient and suppress
them. The remaining vertices represent the connected pieces outside all
regions; a suppressed region supplies a connection between its neighboring
pieces. This is the core graph used by the weighted-tree argument.
