# Suppressing an independent family of path vertices

Remove designated vertices and join each pair of their surviving
neighbors, retaining original edges between surviving vertices. When
the removed vertices are independent and have degree at most two, this
contracts the intervening paths and deletes isolated vertices or leaves.
It is the final contraction from the region-boundary forest to the core
pieces in Monien and Preis's weighted-tree argument.
