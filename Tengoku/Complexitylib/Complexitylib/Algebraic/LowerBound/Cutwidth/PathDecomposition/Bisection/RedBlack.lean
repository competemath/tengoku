# Small components and thin paths in the red/black argument

These are the first two witness constructions in Monien and Preis's core
red/black lemma. A red edge inside one small black component, or between
two such components, gives a positive set. A black path with many red
attachments relative to its length also gives a uniformly bounded positive
set: choose three nearby attachments, retain the subpath between them, and
add their black components.

`WeightedTree` supplies the light adjacent-pair lemma, `RedBlack.Restoration`
the local compensation for deleted black edges, and `Restoration.Family`
a uniform bound for restoring a whole family. `CycleRemoval` selects
regions to isolate in a supplied degree-two family and excludes all cycles
through that family. `PathSystem` constructs the family from eligible
vertices and their actual red attachments. Its initial attachment marks
and their shared budget with small cyclic components are counted exactly.
Preserving marks through the tree reorganization is not formalized:
`RedBlack.Clusters` proves the red/black density lemma by bounded connected
partitions instead, and `Bisection.exists_bisectionBound` uses it.
These constructions also apply after black-edge deletions; they do not
require cubic regularity.
