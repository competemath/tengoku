# Eliminating boundary edges with a uniform reverse bound

The original boundary graph is a matching once small helpful sets have
been excluded. Reversing a switch completes one of these disjoint pairs.
Keep the selected boundary vertices inside their original pair closure,
and charge at most two new vertices per new boundary vertex. This gives
a factor-three bound for the entire sequence, independent of its length.
