# Helpfulness of a vertex move

Monien and Preis measure a move by the crossing edges it removes minus
those it creates. Integer subtraction retains the cost of an unhelpful move.
When the moved set lies in one side, this is their helpfulness definition.
The definition also applies when vertices are flipped on both sides.

/-- The signed cut reduction obtained by flipping the vertices in `X`.
The intersection counts crossing edges removed by the flip; the difference
counts previously internal edges that become crossing. For `X ⊆ S`, this
is the helpfulness of moving `X` from side `S` to its complement. -/
