# Lifting a red/black witness through the cut boundary

In the normalized side of Monien and Preis's helpful-set argument, each
boundary vertex has one outside neighbor and two nonboundary neighbors.
It represents a red edge between those two neighbors. Boundary vertices
remain distinct, so parallel red edges retain their multiplicity.
