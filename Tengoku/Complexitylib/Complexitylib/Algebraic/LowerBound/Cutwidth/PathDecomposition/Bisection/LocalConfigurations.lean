# Helpful configurations used in normalization

Monien and Preis's *Upper Bounds on the Bisection Width of 3- and 4-regular
Graphs* excludes five local configurations before normalizing the graph.
`Improvement` covers the singleton and connected-boundary cases. This module
proves the remaining witnesses of at most five, seven, and eleven vertices.
All statements allow a subcubic graph and overlapping boundary neighborhoods.

The eleven-vertex construction starts with a nonnegative-helpfulness set
of at most four vertices, then closes a small interior set under its neighbors.
Its contrapositive supplies the interior neighbor of boundary degree at most
one needed for an edge switch. `EdgeSwitch` proves one switch and its local
reverse transfer. `BoundaryNormalization` and `NeighborNormalization` complete
both phases with a uniform bound on their combined reverse extension.
