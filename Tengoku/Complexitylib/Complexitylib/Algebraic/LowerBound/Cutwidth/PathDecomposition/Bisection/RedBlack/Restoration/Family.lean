# Restoring a whole family with a uniform size bound

A positive witness avoiding the isolated regions transfers back to the
original graph by adding just those regions whose cuts touch the witness,
together with their closed attachments. Each selected region contributes
at most one new external black edge and a distinct new internal red edge.
The size bound depends on the original witness, not the number of regions.
Attached sets may overlap and may already be partly selected.
The mark-based bound charges only the endpoint marks on the witness,
at most one region-plus-attachment size per such mark.
If the original set is closed in the deleted graph and contains every
outside endpoint of some nonempty region boundary, restoration creates
positivity: that region supplies a red edge with no remaining black cost.

For black degree at most three and region-plus-attachment size at most `4 M`,
the bound is `(1 + 12 M) |X|`. Thus an `O(M)` witness remains `O(M²)` after
all paths are restored, as required in Monien and Preis's cycle-removal
argument. `PathSystem` constructs the thin family with `L = 3 M`, giving
the factor `1 + 9 M`. Tree reorganization is not formalized; `RedBlack.Clusters`
proves the red/black lemma by another route.
