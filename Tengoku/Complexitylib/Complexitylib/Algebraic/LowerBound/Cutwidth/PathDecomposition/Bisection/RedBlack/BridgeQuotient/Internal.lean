# Connectivity and acyclicity of bridge quotients

Walks project to the component quotient and quotient walks lift through
the connected contracted pieces. An original bridge remains a bridge in
the quotient: a quotient path avoiding its image would lift to an original
path avoiding the bridge. Thus contracting along the complement of a set
of bridges produces a forest, and a tree when the original graph is connected.
