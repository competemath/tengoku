# Local improvements of a graph bisection

These are the cut identities, minimization argument, and first local cases
in Monien and Preis's *Upper Bounds on the Bisection Width of 3- and
4-regular Graphs*. A helpful move decreases the cut by exactly its signed
helpfulness. An equally sized reverse move restores balance; if the total
helpfulness is positive, the original cut was not minimal.

A subcubic vertex with two crossing edges is helpful. More generally, a
connected set of boundary vertices has helpfulness at least its size minus
two. `Bisection.LocalConfigurations` proves the remaining small configurations
used before normalization. `Bisection.Rebalancing` supplies the rebalancing step. The bounded
local helpful-set lemma needed for the sharp bisection theorem is
`Bisection.exists_bounded_helpful` in `Bisection.Helpful`.
