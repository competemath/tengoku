# Root deletion and connected remainder unions

Every component left after deleting a root from a connected set contains
a neighbor of that root. Distinct components give distinct neighbors, so
their number is bounded by the root's degree. Small connected sets rooted
at those neighbors join to a connected set after the root is restored.
