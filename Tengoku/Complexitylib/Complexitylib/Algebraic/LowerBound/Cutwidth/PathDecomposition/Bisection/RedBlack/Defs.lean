# Positive sets in a red/black graph

Monien and Preis's core lemma seeks a set with more internal red edges
than external black edges. The black graph is simple; the red graph retains
edge identities, allowing parallel edges created by suppressing boundary
vertices. Degree and density assumptions belong to the theorems that need
them, since the proof also deletes black edges.
