# The graph of components separated by designated edges

Delete a set of designated edges and take the connected components of what
remains. Two components are adjacent in the quotient when an original edge
joins them. When the designated edges are bridges, this quotient is a
forest, even if the contracted components themselves contain cycles.
This is the contraction used in Monien and Preis's red/black tree argument.
