# Counting the connections left by path suppression

In a forest, two different intermediate vertices cannot give paths between
the same endpoints. For a bipartition with degree at most two on the removed
side, each removed degree-two vertex therefore gives exactly one distinct
edge of the suppressed graph. Isolated vertices and leaves give no edges.
