# Restoring the black cut of an added set

Monien and Preis's red/black argument temporarily disconnects thin paths.
Adding a path and its attached small components compensates for restoring
the deleted edges. This module proves the cut and red-edge accounting for
one such restoration. `Restoration.Family` proves a uniform size bound for
restoring an entire family of isolated regions with closed red attachments.

The added set may overlap the existing witness in whole black components.
The empty-cut condition on the overlap makes this precise; only red edges
not already internal to the witness count toward the compensation.
