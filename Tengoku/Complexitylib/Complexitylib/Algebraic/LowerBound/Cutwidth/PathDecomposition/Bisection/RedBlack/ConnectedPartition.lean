# Bounded connected partitions of subcubic graphs

A connected subcubic graph on more than `M` vertices can be partitioned
into connected pieces of size at most `3 M`, with at most `2 n / M`
pieces. The proof recursively removes a root, partitions the resulting
components, and joins their small remainders through the root.

This supplies the bounded pieces used by the red/black density argument
in `RedBlack.Clusters`.
