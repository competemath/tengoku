# Bounded changes on a Boolean cube

A bound for changing one coordinate extends to the ordinary, unnormalized
Hamming distance. It also gives a discrete intermediate-value theorem: a
natural-valued function on a finite Boolean cube cannot skip an interval
wider than its one-coordinate bound. Neither conclusion assumes monotonicity.
