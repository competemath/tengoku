# Accepting exactly half of a successful phase

The menu guarantee permits a fixed-size acceptance step: choose exactly
`ceil(active/2)` clean requests. Their recovery lines avoid all occupied
points and are pairwise disjoint, while exactly `floor(active/2)` requests
remain. The existential selection here specifies the semantic obligation of
the circuit's first-clean-request selection pass.
