# A cut witnessing many collisions

A spanning forest has the same nonisolated vertices as the original graph.
Its two-coloring gives a cut across which every nonisolated vertex has a
neighbor. At least half of any specified set of nonisolated vertices lie on
one side of this cut. Restricting that side to the specified vertices keeps
all its witnesses outside the chosen set.

For the scheduler, vertices are requests together with an occupied-set
vertex. Conditioning on directions outside the selected requests then makes
their collision tests independent. No independence of graph edges is needed.
