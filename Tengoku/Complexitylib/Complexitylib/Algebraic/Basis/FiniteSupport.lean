# Finite-support semantics

`FiniteSupport M` is the idempotent support carrier used by monotone
arithmetic interpretations.  Addition unions supports, while multiplication
takes all pairwise products.  No algebraic laws on `M` are imposed here: the
arithmetic circuit syntax only needs total binary operations, and concrete
applications can add monoid or exponent-vector structure as needed.
