# The elementary sunflower bound

The Erdős--Rado induction used by the monotone CLIQUE approximation method is
formalized here for finite set families.  A `p`-sunflower is a `p`-element
subfamily whose distinct members have one common pairwise intersection.

The quantitative endpoint is the classical elementary bound

`family.card > (p - 1) ^ width * width!`.

For families whose members have size *at most* `width`, the proof partitions
the family by cardinality and applies the uniform bound to a large layer.
