# Finite-deviation functions are polynomial-time

A function that agrees with the constant empty-output function on all but
finitely many inputs is polynomial-time computable. Concretely, for any target
function `g` and finite set `S`, the function `fun s => if s ∈ S then g s else []`
belongs to `FP`: the finite lookup table can be hard-wired into the states of a
Turing machine that decides membership in `S` while scanning the input and then
emits the corresponding fixed output, all in linear time.

This is the base case for building up polynomial-time functions — every function
with finite support (relative to the empty output) is trivially in `FP`,
regardless of how the values `g s` are chosen.

The same lookup handles anything that depends on a *bounded key*: if a
polynomial-time function extracts a key of bounded length, then any value or
test of that key is polynomial-time, since there are only finitely many keys.
The rule applied to the key need not be computable; a constraint given by an
alphabet embedding chosen by `Classical.choice`, say, still runs in polynomial
time.

## Main definitions

- `Complexity.keySet` — the strings of bounded length satisfying a predicate

## Main results

- `ite_mem_finset_mem_FP` — `fun s => if s ∈ S then g s else []` belongs to `FP`
- `mem_FP_of_bounded_key` — a value of a bounded key is polynomial-time
- `FPPred.of_bounded_key` — so is a test of a bounded key
