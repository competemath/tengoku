# Finite uniform-seed distribution ensembles -- definitions

`FiniteEnsemble α` allows each parameter slice to use any nonempty finite uniform
seed type. This strictly generalizes fixed-length Boolean seeds and, crucially,
supports exact choices such as a uniform element of `Fin m` when `m` is not a
power of two.

The distribution remembers sampler multiplicity: probability is the fraction of
seeds whose samples satisfy an event, not the fraction of distinct outputs.
