# The auxiliary-unary distribution -- definitions

For a positive size parameter `m`, Hirahara's auxiliary-unary distribution
chooses a clock length `t` uniformly from `{1, ..., m}`, chooses a uniform
binary string `x` of length `m - t`, and outputs the canonical encoding of
`(x, 1^t)`.

We represent the same experiment by choosing the binary length
`n = m - t` uniformly from `{0, ..., m - 1}` and an independent uniform
`m`-bit string, whose first `n` bits are retained. The unused suffix makes all
split choices live in one uniform finite seed space. At `m = 0`, where the
paper's positive-length distribution is not specified, the totalized ensemble
uses the unique empty seed and outputs `pair [] []`. Here `m` is the sum of the
two component lengths; the self-delimiting binary encoding `pair x 1^t` has its
own codec overhead and need not itself have list length `m`.
