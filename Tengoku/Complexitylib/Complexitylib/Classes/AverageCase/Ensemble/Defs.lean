# Exact dyadic distribution ensembles -- definitions

A `DyadicEnsemble α` represents each parameter slice by a uniformly random
finite Boolean seed and a deterministic sample map. Repeated samples may map to
the same output, so this representation captures arbitrary finite dyadic
distributions without quotienting away sampler multiplicity.

This is the representation-independent finite layer needed by average-case
complexity. Polynomial-time samplability is a separate machine-level property.
