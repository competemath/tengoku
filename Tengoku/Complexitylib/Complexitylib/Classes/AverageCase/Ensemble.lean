# Exact dyadic distribution ensembles

This module exposes finite distribution ensembles represented by uniform Boolean
seeds. It provides exact event probabilities, pushforwards, point masses,
independent products, and normalization of the induced finite mass function.

Polynomial-time samplability and heuristic algorithms are deliberately separate
layers: these definitions and counting theorems make no computational claim about
the sample map.
