# Finite uniform-seed distribution ensembles

This module exposes exact distributions generated from arbitrary nonempty finite
uniform seed spaces. It generalizes dyadic ensembles while preserving sampler
multiplicity, and provides probability laws, pushforwards, products, point
masses, normalization, and an exact dyadic-to-finite bridge.
