# Errorless average-case heuristics -- definitions

An errorless heuristic answers yes, answers no, or explicitly fails. It may fail
on any input but may never return an incorrect Boolean answer. Average-case
complexity bounds the probability of the failure event under a distribution
ensemble.

The canonical answer codec uses `[]` for failure, `[false]` for rejection, and
`[true]` for acceptance. Consequently, polynomial runtime is stated directly as
membership of the encoded answer function in the existing class `FP`.

The heuristic never sees the slice index `n`, and its time is polynomial in the
sample length `|x|`. A `FiniteEnsemble` may draw samples much shorter than `n`,
and then this is stricter than the textbook time bound polynomial in `n`; a
future `DistNP` should require samples of length polynomially related to `n`. -/
