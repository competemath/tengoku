# Property density

The **density** of a property of `n`-bit Boolean functions: the fraction of the
`2 ^ (2 ^ n)` Boolean functions that the property contains, as an exact rational
(toward natural-proofs largeness). This mirrors the
random-bit `eventProb` layer but over the sample space of all Boolean functions.

## Main results

- `density` with `density_nonneg`, `density_le_one`, the complement identity
  `density_compl`, and the union bound `density_union_le`
