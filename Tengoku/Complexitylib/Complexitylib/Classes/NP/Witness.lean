# NP witness characterization

This file states the textbook characterization of `NP` via FNP witness
relations:

> A language `L` is in `NP` iff there is an FNP relation `R` such that
> `x ∈ L ↔ ∃ y, R x y`.

The forward direction (`NP ⊆ witness form`) is a *computation-path* witness
argument and is left for a later pass.

The reverse direction — **the FNP ⇒ NP bridge** — is captured here by
`mem_NP_of_FNP_witness`, parameterized by the single TM-engineering
construction interface `WitnessNTMConstruction`: build the nondeterministic
"guess-and-verify" machine from a deterministic verifier of `pairLang R`.
Everything above that construction — unpacking FNP, computing polynomial
bounds, and packaging the result as membership in `NP` — is proved here.

The construction itself is proved as `NP.witnessNTMConstruction` in
`Complexitylib.Classes.NP.WitnessConstruction`, which also states the
unconditional forms `NP.mem_NP_of_FNP` and `NP.witnessLang_mem_NP`. It lives
downstream because the guess-and-verify machine is built from modules that
import this one.

## How `WitnessNTMConstruction` is proved

The proof (`mem_NP_of_poly_witness`, in
`Complexitylib.Classes.NP.Verifier`) has two steps.

1. **Linear witnesses** (`mem_NP_of_linear_witness`). The generic
   `WitnessTM.Verifier.compile` machine computes the bound `|x| + 1`, stores
   a bounded finite certificate on charged work tape, constructs `pair x y`,
   and runs the ordinary verifier. Online-witness equivalence supplies the
   NTM. The compiler records explicit time and independent space bounds.
2. **Polynomial witnesses by padding.** For a witness bound `p`, the input `x`
   is padded to `pair x r` with a ruler long enough that the bound becomes
   linear in the padded length (`padWith`). The language is the preimage of
   the padded language `padLang p L₀` under this polynomial-time map, and `NP`
   is closed under such preimages (`mem_NP_preimage`).

The compiler's linear-instance runtime is explicit. The padding-based
polynomial-witness corollary remains stated as membership in `NP`.

/-- **Guess-and-verify NTM construction interface.** Given a DTM `M` deciding
    `pairLang R` within a time bound `T(n) ≤ O(n^c)` and a polynomial `p`
    bounding witness length, there exists an NTM deciding
    `witnessLang R = {x | ∃ y, R x y}` in polynomial time.

    The textbook (Arora–Barak) machine nondeterministically writes a witness
    of length `≤ p(|x|)`, builds `pair(x, y)`, and simulates `M`. The library's
    proof instead guesses witnesses of length at most `|x| + 1` and reaches a
    general polynomial bound by padding the input (see the module docstring).

    This is isolated as a named proposition so that this file's results can
    be stated before the machine is available in the import graph. It is
    proved as `NP.witnessNTMConstruction` in
    `Complexitylib.Classes.NP.WitnessConstruction`. -/

/-- **FNP ⇒ NP via witnesses.** If the generic guess-and-verify construction
    has been implemented, `R ∈ FNP`, and `x ∈ L ↔ ∃ y, R x y`, then
    `L ∈ NP`. Proof: unpack FNP to get a polynomial-time DTM verifier
    `M` for `pairLang R` and a polynomial witness-length bound, apply the
    construction to build the guess-and-verify NTM, and package the result as
    NP membership. -/
