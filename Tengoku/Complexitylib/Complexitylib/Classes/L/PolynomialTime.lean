# Log-space transducers run in polynomial time

The finite reduced-configuration theorem for one-way-output deterministic
transducers makes a logarithmic auxiliary-space bound into a polynomial time
bound. Consequently `L ⊆ P` and `FL ⊆ FP`.

## Main results

- `TM.transducerConfigBound_bigO_polynomial` — logarithmic space gives a
  polynomial reduced-configuration bound
- `L_subset_P` — deterministic log-space languages are polynomial-time
- `FL_subset_FP` — deterministic log-space functions are polynomial-time
