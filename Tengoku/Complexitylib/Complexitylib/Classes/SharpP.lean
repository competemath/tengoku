# The counting class `#P`

**#P** (sharp-P) is the class of functions that count the accepting leaves of a
polynomial-time nondeterministic computation tree.

This is deliberately distinct from `NTM.acceptCount`, which counts fixed-length
choice strings for probabilistic semantics. If a machine halts early, all
extensions of that random string must retain their multiplicity when computing a
probability, but the halted computation is only one leaf of a nondeterministic
tree. `NTM.acceptLeafCount` implements the latter convention and is invariant
under extending any clock by which every path has halted.

## Main definitions and results

- `SharpP` — the counting class
- `NTM.acceptCount_le` — a machine has at most `2 ^ T` accepting fixed-clock
  choice strings among the `2 ^ T` length-`T` strings
- `NTM.acceptLeafCount_eq_of_le_of_allPathsHaltIn` — accepting-leaf counts do not
  depend on the choice of a sufficient clock
- `SharpP.le_two_pow` — every `#P` function is bounded by `2 ^ T(|x|)` for its
  polynomial clock `T`
