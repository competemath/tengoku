# The Hadamard tester, as it actually runs

`Complexitylib.Classes.PCP.Internal.Hadamard` analyses the tester at the
*decoded* level: its statements are about the codewords `hadamard a` and
`hadamard b` that the two proof tables are supposed to be. A tester cannot read
those. It reads the tables it is given, which are only *close* to codewords, and
it recovers codeword values by self-correction — reading two nearby entries and
multiplying.

This module closes that gap. The tester's whole random string is one point of a
bundled cube (`CubeBlocks`): the first block picks the two query points, and the
remaining blocks supply one correction string per read. Every read is then
correct except with probability `2ε`, the failures are collected by a union
bound, and `prob_le_of_imp_of_good` transfers the observed acceptance
probability to the decoded check that `Hadamard` already knows how to use.

The one wrinkle is that the consistency check is *bilinear over `𝔽₂`*, not
multiplicative on signs: `⟨a ⊗ a, x ⊗ y⟩ = ⟨a, x⟩ · ⟨a, y⟩` is a product of
bits, and `chi` does not carry products of bits to products of signs. So the
reads' `±1` answers are converted back to bits by `signBit` before being
compared, which is exactly how the check is stated in the literature.

## Main definitions

- `Complexity.signBit` — the bit a `±1` answer stands for
- `Complexity.TesterAccepts` — the tester's check on the raw tables
- `Complexity.ReadsCorrect` — the event that every self-corrected read is right

## Main results

- `Complexity.prob_reads_correct` — every read is right except with
  probability `4ε + 2ε'`
- `Complexity.prob_testerAccepts_of_honest` — completeness: the honest proof
  is accepted always
- `Complexity.sat_of_prob_tester` — **soundness of the tester as it runs**: if
  the raw tables are close to codewords and the raw check passes often enough,
  the decoded assignment satisfies the constraint
- `Complexity.exists_sat_of_prob_tester` — the same with *nothing* assumed
  about the proof: BLR supplies the closeness
