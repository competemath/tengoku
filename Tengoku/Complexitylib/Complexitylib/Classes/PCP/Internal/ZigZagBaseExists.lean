# A base graph for the tower exists

The zig-zag tower is seeded by a single finite graph whose vertices number the
fourth power of its degree and whose spectral bound is a fifth. Such a graph is
what Reingold, Vadhan and Wigderson find by exhaustive search; here it comes
from any expander family at all, by raising one member to a power.

Powering leaves the vertex set alone and raises both the degree and the bound
to the same power, so taking the member on `degree ^ (4 * m)` vertices and
powering it `m` times gives `degree ^ (4 * m) = (degree ^ m) ^ 4` vertices
against degree `degree ^ m` — and `lam ^ m ≤ 1 / 5` once `m` is large enough.

Applied to `randExpander`, this shows a `ZigZagBase` exists.

## Main definitions

- `Complexity.ExpanderFamily.fifthExp` — a power taking the bound below a fifth
- `Complexity.ExpanderFamily.toZigZagBase` — the base graph

## Main results

- `Complexity.nonempty_zigZagBase` — a base graph exists
