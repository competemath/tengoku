# The zig-zag tower

One graph of constant size generates an infinite family. Square a member — the
degree becomes the fourth power of the base's, exactly the number of the base's
vertices — and zig-zag with the base: the vertex count is multiplied by that
same number while the degree drops back to the base's squared.

The spectral bookkeeping is what makes the recursion close. If the base has
bound `lam ≤ 1/5` and a member has bound `2/5`, squaring gives `4/25` and the
zig-zag estimate `λ(G ⓩ H) ≤ λ(G) + λ(H) + λ(H)²` gives at most
`4/25 + 1/5 + 1/25 = 2/5`, the invariant again.

Only the base is non-constructive; the recursion itself is an algorithm, which
is why this yields an expander family a machine can build.

## Main definitions

- `Complexity.ZigZagBase` — a constant-size graph to build from
- `Complexity.TowerStep` — a member of the family, with its invariants
- `Complexity.towerSucc` — one round of squaring and zig-zagging

## Main results

- `Complexity.towerSucc` carries the invariants forward, by construction
- `Complexity.ZigZagBase.order_tower` — the sizes are the powers of `deg ^ 4`
