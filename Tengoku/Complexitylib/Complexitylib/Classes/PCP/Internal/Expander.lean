# Expander families, and expanderizing a graph

Dinur's preprocessing needs a *fixed* constant degree `d` and a constant
`lam < 1` such that every vertex count admits a `d`-regular graph with spectral
bound `lam`. `ExpanderFamily` packages exactly that.

The family is given as **raw rotation data** on `Fin n × Fin degree`, one
involution per vertex count, rather than as a function into `RegGraph`. That
matters downstream: degree reduction puts an expander on the cloud of *every*
vertex at once, and those clouds have different sizes, so all of them must speak
the same label type `Fin degree`. Deriving the graphs from shared data gives
that for free, and makes `order` and `deg` computations `Fintype.card_fin`
rather than hypotheses.

Isolating the requirement this way matters for a second reason: nothing else in
the development depends on *how* the family is built. Neither Mathlib nor this
library currently contains an explicit expander construction — no spectral gap,
edge expansion, Cheeger inequality, or zig-zag product — so producing an
`ExpanderFamily` is a self-contained sub-project (zig-zag, or a Margulis-type
Cayley construction), and everything downstream is already stated against this
interface.

## Main definitions

- `RegGraph.ofRot` — a graph on `Fin n` from a rotation involution
- `ExpanderFamily` — constant degree, uniform spectral bound, shared label type
- `ExpanderFamily.graph`, `ExpanderFamily.expanderize`

## Main results

- `ExpanderFamily.order_graph`, `ExpanderFamily.deg_graph`
- `ExpanderFamily.spectralBound_expanderize` — expanderization has a bound
- `ExpanderFamily.expanderize_bound_lt_one` — and the bound is below one
