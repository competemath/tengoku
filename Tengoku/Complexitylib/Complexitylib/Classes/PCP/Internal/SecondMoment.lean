# A second-moment support bound

The Paley–Zygmund style inequality behind Dinur's powering estimate: a
nonnegative random variable is nonzero on a set at least as large as the square
of its mean over its second moment. Written with sums rather than expectations,
so that the normalising cardinality cancels on its own:

`(∑ N) ^ 2 ≤ |support N| · ∑ N ^ 2`

In the powering analysis `N` counts how many *faulty* edges a random walk
traverses. The first moment is proportional to the gap, the second moment is
controlled by the expander mixing lemma, and this inequality converts the two
into a lower bound on the probability that the walk meets a faulty edge at all
— which is what the powered constraint detects.

## Main results

- `sq_sum_le_card_support_mul_sum_sq` — the inequality above
- `sq_sum_div_sum_sq_le_card_support` — its ratio form
- `card_ge_of_moments` — Paley–Zygmund in counting form

/-- **Paley–Zygmund, in counting form.** If a nonnegative count has first moment
at least `A` and second moment at most `B`, then at least `A ^ 2 / B` of the
indices carry a nonzero count. Any `S` containing the support inherits the
bound — in the powering argument `S` is the set of unsatisfied constraints and
the count is the number of crossings that break one. -/
