# Blocks of a cube, and marginals

An assignment tester makes several reads, each with its own randomness. The
Fourier layer supplies probability over *one* cube point (`Pr`) and over a pair
(`Pr₂`), but not over `k` independent points, and building a `k`-fold product
measure would be a detour.

The alternative taken here is to bundle: the tester's whole random string is a
single point of a larger cube, and each read uses its own block. What makes this
work is that the uniform measure on the big cube restricts to the uniform measure
on each block — proved below — so the existing one-variable lemmas apply to each
read, and the existing union bound combines them.

## Main definitions

- `Complexity.leftBlock`, `Complexity.rightBlock` — the two halves of a point

## Main results

- `Complexity.prob_leftBlock`, `Complexity.prob_rightBlock` — a block is
  uniformly distributed
- `Complexity.prob_forall_ge` — the union bound combining many reads
- `Complexity.prob_leftBlock_rightBlock` — marginals compose, so any fixed
  number of blocks can be bundled
- `Complexity.prob₂_eq_prob_blocks` — a probability over a pair is a
  probability over one bundled point
- `Complexity.prob_le_of_imp_of_good` — transferring an observed acceptance
  probability along a likely good event
- `Complexity.prob_blocks`, `Complexity.prob_blocks_ge` — conditioning on an
  earlier block, so a read point may depend on earlier randomness

rewriting, both are probabilities over one cube, so a union bound applies. -/
