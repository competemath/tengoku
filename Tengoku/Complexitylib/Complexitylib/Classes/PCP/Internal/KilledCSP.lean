# Powering a constraint system along killed walks

Dinur's gap amplification, over the walk law of `KilledWalk`. The vertices are
unchanged; the constraints are indexed by killed walks, and the alphabet is
*opinions* — but now indexed by walks of **any** length up to `T`, so that no
padding is ever needed.

## Opinions

A label at `v` is a function `VarWalk G T → α`: for every walk out of `v` of
length at most `T`, a claim about the label of its endpoint. The index type is
finite of size `∑_{ℓ ≤ T} deg ^ ℓ`, so the alphabet stays a constant
`|α| ^ (∑_{ℓ ≤ T} deg ^ ℓ)`, independent of the number of vertices — which is
what makes the alphabet-reduction step afterwards possible.

Variable-length indices are the point of the design. Were the indices instead
walks of one fixed length, a short prefix would have to be padded out with
self-loops, and the padded indices would form a vanishing sub-cube that the
plurality bound cannot see — which sinks soundness. `KilledWalk` records the
counting behind that failure.

## The constraint

On a killed walk `(v, x)` with effective length `ℓ`, **every** step `i < ℓ` is
checked — no window is needed, since the start's opinion reaches `v i` through
the walk's own first `i` steps and the end's reaches `v (i+1)` through the
reversed walk's first `ℓ - (i+1)` steps. Both indices are genuine walks, of the
exact lengths the walk itself provides.

## Main definitions

- `VarWalk`, `KOpinion` — short walks, and the alphabet of opinions about them
- `RegGraph.startIdx`, `RegGraph.endIdx` — the two indices a step is read at
- `RegCSP.killedPow` — the powered system
- `RegCSP.kTruthful` — the opinion assignment induced by an assignment of `R`

## Main results

- `RegGraph.walkEnd_startIdx`, `RegGraph.walkEnd_endIdx` — the two indices name
  the two ends of the `i`-th dart
- `RegCSP.rel_killedPow_iff` — the constraint, unfolded
- `RegCSP.satisfiable_killedPow_of_satisfiable` — perfect completeness
- `RegCSP.not_satisfies_killedPow_of_faulty` — the soundness witness: a failed
  step with truthful opinions at both ends breaks the constraint
