# Constraint graphs and their unsatisfiability value

The combinatorial core of Dinur's proof of the PCP theorem. A *constraint
graph* over an alphabet `α` is a finite multigraph whose edges each carry a
binary constraint on the labels of their endpoints; an *assignment* labels the
vertices, and the *unsatisfiability value* `unsatVal` is the least fraction of
edges any assignment leaves unsatisfied.

Dinur's amplification step is a transformation of constraint graphs that
preserves satisfiability (`unsatVal = 0`) while doubling `unsatVal` otherwise,
so all of that argument is phrased in terms of the definitions here.

## Design

- Vertices are `Fin numVerts` and edges are *indexed* by `Fin numEdges`, so
  parallel edges and self-loops are allowed. Both are essential: powering a
  constraint graph produces many parallel walk-edges, and the degree-reduction
  and expanderization steps add edges to a graph that may already have them.
- Edges are directed (`tail`/`head`) and constraints are `Bool`-valued
  functions of the two endpoint labels, which keeps everything decidable and
  computable. Undirected graphs are modelled by including both orientations,
  which the analysis of random walks will require explicitly rather than
  implicitly.
- `unsatFrac` divides by `numEdges`, so an edgeless graph gets value `0` by
  Lean's `x / 0 = 0` convention. Every lemma below is stated so that this is
  the mathematically correct answer.

## Main definitions

- `ConstraintGraph`, `ConstraintGraph.Assignment`, `ConstraintGraph.Satisfies`
- `ConstraintGraph.unsatFrac` — the fraction of edges an assignment fails
- `ConstraintGraph.unsatVal` — the minimum of `unsatFrac` over all assignments
- `ConstraintGraph.Satisfiable`

## Main results

- `unsatFrac_eq_zero_iff` — an assignment wastes no edges exactly when it
  satisfies them all
- `exists_assignment_unsatFrac_eq_unsatVal` — the minimum is attained
- `unsatVal_eq_zero_iff_satisfiable` — the gap-`0` case is satisfiability
- `unsatVal_nonneg`, `unsatVal_le_one`
