# The assignment tester, assembled

The six checks of the Hadamard assignment tester, run on one bundled random
string, on raw tables, with a universal soundness constant.

The tester is handed two **input tables** `Tt Th : Cube B → ZMod 2` — in the
composition, the Hadamard encodings of the labels at the two ends of an outer
edge — and a **proof** consisting of a linear table `F` over `n` variables and
a quadratic table `G` over `n * n`, where the `n` variables are the `2 · 2^B`
input coordinates followed by the selectors of a one-hot system. Its random
string has six blocks, one per check:

1. linearity of `F`; 2. linearity of `G`; 3. consistency of `G` with `F`;
4. the one-hot system, by a random linear combination; 5. and 6. the two
input tables, one coordinate each.

Every check reads a constant number of positions — never a whole table — so
the total query count is a constant independent of `B`, and the soundness
constant `1/32` is universal. That independence is the point of the tester:
the outer alphabet may be enormous, and neither the query count nor the
soundness loss may notice.

## Main definitions

- `Complexity.Tester.AllChecks` — the tester's verdict on a random string

## Main results

- `Complexity.Tester.sound` — passing with probability above `31/32` yields an
  assignment satisfying the system whose input parts are within `3/32` of the
  input tables
- `Complexity.Tester.complete` — the honest proof of a satisfying assignment
  passes on every random string
