# The remaining checks of the assignment tester

`HadamardTester` proves the linearity and consistency checks. Two more are
needed for the tester to plug into Dinur's composition, and both are analysed
here on raw tables, over bundled randomness, in the same style.

* **The constraint check on a system.** The constraint is a *system* of
  quadratic equations (the one-hot arithmetization of `Arithmetize`), checked
  by one random linear combination. Passing on more than half of the
  coefficient vectors — after paying for the reads — forces every equation to
  hold on the decoded tables.

* **The input check, one coordinate at a time.** The tester is handed its
  input as a table it may read at a single random coordinate, and compares that
  bit with the corresponding coordinate of its decoded assignment, obtained by
  self-correction at a basis vector. Passing often means the input table is
  *close* to the decoded assignment's input part — not equal, which a single
  read could never certify, but close enough that, when the input is supposed
  to be a Hadamard codeword, it decodes uniquely.

The last point is what makes the composition work with constantly many
queries: the outer graph's labels are handed to the tester as Hadamard
codewords, and a wrong label is far from every right one.

## Main results

- `Complexity.forall_checkValue_of_prob_combined` — the random-combination
  constraint check
- `Complexity.prob_coord_eq_ge` — the single-coordinate input check
- `Complexity.decodeLabel_eq` — a table close to a codeword decodes to it

off the raw tables passes often enough only if every constraint of the system
holds on the decoded tables. The coefficient vector is the first block, the
