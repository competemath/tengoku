# Disagreement across an expander

The counting fact that makes Dinur's clouds work. A cloud is wired by an
expander and carries equality constraints, so an assignment that is not constant
on the cloud must break many of them. Quantitatively: if `f` labels the vertices
of an expander and `S` is the set of vertices whose label differs from some
fixed value `c`, then at least `(1 - lam) · deg · |S| · |Sᶜ| / n` darts join two
vertices with *different* labels — because every dart from `S` to `Sᶜ` does, and
`EdgeExpansion` counts those.

Taking `c` to be a plurality value of `f` — which by pigeonhole is held by at
least a `1 / |α|` fraction of the vertices — turns this into

`(1 - lam) · deg · |S| / |α| ≤ #disagreeing darts`,

a bound linear in the number of deviant vertices, with a constant depending only
on the expander and the alphabet. That is exactly the exchange rate degree
reduction needs: each vertex that lies about its cloud's value pays for itself
in broken equality constraints.

## Main definitions

- `RegGraph.disagreeDarts` — the darts whose two ends carry different labels

## Main results

- `exists_plurality_value` — pigeonhole: some value is held `n / |α|` often
- `RegGraph.card_disagreeDarts_ge` — disagreement is at least the edge boundary
- `RegGraph.card_disagreeDarts_ge_of_plurality` — the form used by clouds
