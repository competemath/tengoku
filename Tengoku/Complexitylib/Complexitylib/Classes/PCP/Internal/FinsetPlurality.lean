# Plurality over a finite set

The pigeonhole fact behind every "decode a cloud by majority vote" step: among
the `Fintype.card α` possible labels, some label is worn by at least a
`1 / Fintype.card α` fraction of a finite set.

Dinur's degree reduction uses this to decode the blown-up assignment — a vertex
is given the label that the most half-edges of its cloud claim — and the bound
below is exactly what makes the *disagreeing* part of a cloud small enough for
the cloud expander to charge it.

## Main results

- `Complexity.exists_plurality` — some label captures at least `1 / card α` of
  the set
