# Gap amplification: the iteration spine of Dinur's proof

Dinur's proof of the PCP theorem rests on a single transformation of constraint
graphs over a *fixed* alphabet that

* blows the graph up by at most a constant factor,
* keeps satisfiable graphs satisfiable, and
* **doubles** the unsatisfiability value, until it reaches a universal
  constant `gap`.

This module packages those three properties as `Amplifier` and derives the
consequence that drives everything else: iterating the transformation
logarithmically many times turns *any* unsatisfiable graph into one whose value
is at least `gap`, while a satisfiable graph stays satisfiable. That is the
constant-gap dichotomy an `O(log n)`-randomness, `O(1)`-query verifier needs.

The construction of an `Amplifier` — degree reduction, expanderization,
powering, and alphabet reduction by composition — is the mathematical content
of the proof and lives in the sibling modules. Everything here is independent
of it, and independent of any machine model: the polynomial-time computability
of the iterated transformation is tracked separately.

## Main definitions

- `Amplifier` — the interface above
- `Amplifier.iter` — the `k`-fold iterate

## Main results

- `Amplifier.numEdges_iter_le` — the size grows by at most `edgeFactor ^ k`
- `Amplifier.satisfiable_iter` — satisfiability is preserved
- `Amplifier.unsatVal_iter_ge` — the value is at least `min gap (2 ^ k · v)`
- `Amplifier.gap_le_unsatVal_iter` — after `k` rounds with `numEdges ≤ 2 ^ k`,
  an unsatisfiable graph has value at least `gap`
- `Amplifier.dichotomy` — the two cases together
