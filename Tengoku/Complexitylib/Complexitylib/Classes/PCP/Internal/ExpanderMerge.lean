# The pieces a merge is built from

Explicit expander constructions come in special sizes — squares, powers — but
`ExpanderFamily` wants a member on *every* `n`. An expander on `N` vertices is
folded onto `n` of them by identifying `u` with `u mod n`, with self-loops
padding the fibres that come up short. `MergeGen` carries out that fold at an
arbitrary width; this module holds the two ingredients it rests on.

The first is the estimate on the old steps. Write `f` for a function on the
merged graph and `F = f ∘ π` for its lift. Splitting `F` into its mean and its
centred part and applying the base's spectral bound to the latter gives
`λ² ‖F‖² + (1 - λ²) N c²`, where `c` is the mean of `F` — nonzero, because the
heavier fibres weigh more.

The second is that the fibres stay *balanced*: with `(m - 1) n ≤ N` at most one
of a vertex's `m` slots is empty, so however large the width, the padding costs
one loop per vertex.

## Main definitions

- `Complexity.RegGraph.proj` — the new vertex an old one lands on
- `Complexity.RegGraph.liftN` — the old vertex in a given slot of a fibre

## Main results

- `Complexity.RegGraph.sum_sq_step_lift_le` — the old steps, with the mean
  corrected
- `Complexity.RegGraph.card_liftN_none_le_one` — the balanced fibres a general
  merge needs

/-! ### Balanced fibres, for a merge of any width

With `(m - 1) n ≤ N ≤ m n` every fibre has `m - 1` or `m` elements, so at most
one of the `m` slots is empty and the padding costs one loop per vertex however
large `m` is.

These are the two facts a general merge rests on; they are stated for a
natural-number slot index, which is the form the general construction needs. -/

def liftN (N n : ℕ) (v : Fin n) (i : ℕ) : Option (Fin N) :=
  if h : v.val + i * n < N then some ⟨v.val + i * n, h⟩ else none
