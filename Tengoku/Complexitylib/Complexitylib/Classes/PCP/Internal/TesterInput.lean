# The tester reads its input

An *assignment tester* is not a stand-alone proof system: it is given an input
assignment — in Dinur's composition, the bits the outer constraint graph has
already committed to at the two endpoints of an edge — and must reject unless
those very bits extend to a satisfying assignment. A tester that merely
certifies *some* satisfying assignment exists is useless there, because the
outer graph's assignment would be free to disagree with it.

So the tester needs one more check: that the assignment `a` decoded from its
proof agrees, on the input coordinates, with the input `w` it is handed. The
check is the natural one — pick a random subset of the input coordinates, add up
those bits of `w` directly (the input is a constant number of bits, so this
costs nothing), and compare with the same subset-sum read off the proof by
self-correction.

Soundness is the same rigidity argument that runs throughout the Hadamard
analysis: two assignments whose subset-sums agree on more than half of the
subsets are equal, because their difference would otherwise be a nonzero vector,
and a nonzero vector's subset-sums are odd exactly half the time
(`prob_hadamard_ne_zero`).

## Main definitions

- `Complexity.embedInput` — an input string as a point of the full cube
- `Complexity.InputAccepts` — the input-consistency check on the raw table

## Main results

- `Complexity.eq_of_prob_hadamard_eq` — rigidity: agreeing on more than half
  the subset-sums forces equality
- `Complexity.eq_input_of_prob_inputAccepts` — **the tester verifies its
  input**: passing the check often enough forces the decoded assignment to
  agree with the input
- `Complexity.inputAccepts_of_honest` — and the honest proof always passes
- `Complexity.exists_sat_extending` — **the Hadamard code is an assignment
  tester**: all four checks passing forces the input to extend to a satisfying
  assignment

/-! ### The input-consistency check -/

/-- **The tester's input check**, made on the raw table: a random subset-sum of
the input, computed directly from the input bits, must equal the same subset-sum
read off the proof by self-correction. The first block picks the subset, the
second is the correction string. -/

    (z : Cube (k + (k + t))) : Prop :=
  signBit (f (rightBlock z) * f (embedInput (leftBlock z) + rightBlock z))
    = hadamard w (leftBlock z)

/-- Every read of the input check is right except with probability `2ε`. The
subset is chosen by the first block and the correction by the second, so
`prob_blocks_ge` fixes the read point before the correction is drawn. -/

/-- **The tester verifies its input.** If the input check passes on more than
half the randomness — with room for the reads' failure probability — then the
assignment decoded from the proof agrees with the input on every input
coordinate.

Together with `exists_sat_of_prob_tester` this is the assignment-tester
guarantee Dinur's composition consumes: the proof cannot certify a satisfying
assignment other than an extension of the bits the outer graph committed to. -/
