# Constraint graphs on a regular graph

Dinur's argument runs on constraint graphs whose underlying multigraph is
`d`-regular, because that is what makes random walks and the spectral gap
available. This module puts the two halves together: a `RegCSP` is a `RegGraph`
together with a constraint attached to each **dart**, symmetric under reversal,
so that it is really one constraint per undirected edge.

The measure on constraints is the uniform measure on **darts**: `unsatFrac`
divides the number of unsatisfied darts by `order * deg`. Constraints are
attached to darts rather than to undirected edges, and are *not* required to
agree with their reverse. Nothing is lost: the random walk traverses darts, so
the dart measure is the one every estimate is stated in, and the eventual
verifier samples a dart and checks one constraint. Requiring symmetry instead
would force each construction — powering above all — to prove that reversing a
walk and swapping the two opinions leaves its constraint unchanged, an
index-reversal argument of no mathematical content.

Two presentations of a constraint system coexist in this development, on
purpose. `ConstraintGraph` has its vertex and edge counts as *numeric fields*,
so it is a single type that a transformation can be iterated on (see
`Amplifier`) and that a bitstring encoding can address; `RegCSP` carries
structured vertex and dart types, which is what Dinur's constructions produce.
The bijective bridge between them belongs to the final encoded reduction and is
built there.

## Main definitions

- `RegCSP`, `RegCSP.Dart`, `RegCSP.Assignment`, `RegCSP.satisfies`,
  `RegCSP.Satisfies`, `RegCSP.Satisfiable`, `RegCSP.unsatDarts`
- `RegCSP.unsatFrac`, `RegCSP.unsatVal` — the fraction of darts an assignment
  fails, and its minimum over assignments

## Main results

- `RegCSP.unsatFrac_eq_zero_iff`, `RegCSP.unsatVal_eq_zero_iff_satisfiable` —
  value zero is satisfiability
- `RegCSP.unsatVal_nonneg`, `RegCSP.unsatVal_le_one`
- `RegCSP.inv_card_dart_le_unsatVal` — an unsatisfiable system has value at
  least one dart's worth
