# The counting principle behind inductive counting

⚠️ Unreviewed by Bolton

Immerman–Szelepcsényi's machine cannot store a round of the breadth-first search — that would
take polynomially many bits, not logarithmically many. It stores only the round's *size*, and
recovers everything else by guessing. The reason that is sound is a counting principle: a subset
of a round that is at least as large as the round is the whole round. So a machine that has
verified `r_i` distinct members of round `i`, and has not seen `c` among them, may conclude that
`c` is *not* in round `i` — which is a negative fact, certified positively.

This file isolates that principle and the round recursion it is applied to. Neither mentions a
machine: what remains for `NL ⊆ coNL` is the guessing procedure and its space accounting.

## Main results

- `NTM.reachCodes_mono` — the rounds only grow
- `NTM.eq_reachCodes_of_card_le` — **the counting certificate**
- `NTM.not_mem_reachCodes_of_card_le` — non-membership certified by a count
- `NTM.mem_reachCodes_succ_iff` — the round recursion the count is carried along
- `NTM.not_mem_iff_forall_not_accepting` — the complement characterization `coNL` needs
- `NTM.reachSet_eq_of_ncard_le` — the counting certificate for the specification-level rounds
- `NL_complement_characterization_internal` — the complement of an `NL` language, as a
  universally quantified statement over the rounds of the search
- `mem_NL_of_logWindow` — an explicit logarithmic window suffices for `NL`
- `NL_subset_coNL_of_counting_internal` — the containment, modulo one machine

/-! ## The rounds as growing finite sets -/

/-- The round recursion, as a membership statement: a code is in the next round exactly when it
is already present or is a successor of something present. -/

    (a : Code tm.Q k x.length S) :

/-- Each round contains the previous one. -/

    reachCodes tm x S a₀ i ⊆ reachCodes tm x S a₀ (i + 1) :=
  fun _ h => (mem_reachCodes_succ_iff a₀ i _).mpr (Or.inl h)

/-- The rounds only grow. -/
theorem reachCodes_mono (a₀ : Code tm.Q k x.length S) {i j : ℕ} (hij : i ≤ j) :

/-! ## The counting certificate -/

/-- **The counting certificate.** A subset of a round that is at least as large as the round is
the whole round. This is what lets a machine that knows only the round's size conclude a
negative fact from a successful count. -/
theorem eq_reachCodes_of_card_le {a₀ : Code tm.Q k x.length S} {i : ℕ}
    {T : Finset (Code tm.Q k x.length S)} (hsub : T ⊆ reachCodes tm x S a₀ i)

    T = reachCodes tm x S a₀ i :=
  Finset.eq_of_subset_of_card_le hsub hcard

/-- **Non-membership certified by a count.** Having verified as many members of round `i` as the
round has, a code not among them is not in the round at all. -/
theorem not_mem_reachCodes_of_card_le {a₀ : Code tm.Q k x.length S} {i : ℕ}
    {T : Finset (Code tm.Q k x.length S)} (hsub : T ⊆ reachCodes tm x S a₀ i)

/-- Conversely, a verified subset can never exceed the round it sits inside, so the count a
machine accumulates is bounded by the true one. -/

is at least as large is the whole round. -/

/-! ## The complement characterization -/

/-- **What `coNL` has to certify.** An input is *outside* the language exactly when no reachable
configuration of the search is an accepting halted one — a universally quantified statement over
a finite set, which is what inductive counting turns into a nondeterministic verification. -/

/-- **The complement of an `NL` language, spelled out.** An input is outside the language exactly
when *every* configuration the bounded search reaches fails to be accepting. This is the
universally quantified statement inductive counting has to certify nondeterministically. -/

language: the `O(log n)` side is discharged once, here. -/
