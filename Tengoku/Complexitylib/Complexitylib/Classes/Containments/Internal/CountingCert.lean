# The certificate Immerman–Szelepcsényi's machine guesses

⚠️ Unreviewed by Bolton

`Complexitylib.Classes.Containments.Internal.InductiveCounting` isolates the counting principle:
a subset of a round as large as the round *is* the round. This file turns that principle into the
shape a machine can verify, which is what stands between it and `NL ⊆ coNL`.

Two things have to be checkable with only logarithmically many bits in hand.

*Membership in a round* becomes a **walk**: a code lies in round `i` exactly when there is a
sequence of `i` steps from the start, each of which either stays put or moves to a successor
(`Complexity.NTM.mem_reachCodes_iff_walk`). A machine verifies such a walk holding only the
current code and the step index — never the walk itself.

*Non-membership* becomes a **round list**: a list of distinct members of the round, at least as
long as the round (`Complexity.NTM.RoundList`). A machine never holds the list either; it guesses
the entries one at a time, checks each against a walk, counts them, and compares the count against
the round's size. `Complexity.NTM.not_mem_of_roundList` is what licenses the negative conclusion,
and `Complexity.NTM.roundList_exists` is what says an honest prover can always supply one.

/-! ## The complement, as a certificate -/

/-- **The complement of an `NL` language is a certificate a machine can guess.** An input is
*outside* the language exactly when the last round of the search can be listed with none of its
members accepting. Every quantity here is an explicit arithmetic function of the input length,
and the list is only ever consumed one entry at a time: the machine guesses an entry, verifies it
by a walk (`Complexity.NTM.mem_reachCodes_iff_walk`), checks it is not accepting, counts it, and
at the end compares the count against the round's size. That comparison is what makes the
absence of an accepting code a *positive* certificate. -/
