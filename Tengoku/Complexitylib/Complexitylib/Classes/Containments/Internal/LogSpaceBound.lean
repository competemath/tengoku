# The configuration graph of a log-space machine is polynomially sized

⚠️ Unreviewed by Bolton

A machine using `O(log n)` space has only polynomially many configurations: each of the
`4 ^ O(log n)` tape contents is `n ^ O(1)`, and the head positions contribute a further
polynomial factor. This is what turns the graph reachability of
`Complexitylib.Classes.Containments.Internal.ConfigGraph` into a polynomial-time search.

## Main results

- `exists_log_bound` — an `O(log n)` bound holds everywhere after adding a constant
- `four_pow_log_le` — `4 ^ (C · log₂ n + D)` is polynomially bounded
- `exists_config_bound` — the configuration count is `A · (n + 1) ^ B`
