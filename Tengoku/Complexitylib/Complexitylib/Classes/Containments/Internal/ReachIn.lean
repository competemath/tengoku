# Step-counted reachability and the halving recursion

⚠️ Unreviewed by Bolton

Savitch's theorem rests on one combinatorial identity: a walk of at most `m + n` steps is a walk
of at most `m` steps followed by a walk of at most `n` steps, and conversely. Taking `m = n`
turns a bound of `2t` into two independent subproblems with bound `t`, so a bound of `2 ^ i`
recurses to depth `i` — the recursion whose stack a space-bounded machine can afford because
each level stores only one midpoint.

Nothing here is about space, and nothing is about a machine: this is the pure statement that the
midpoint search is correct, which is the part of Savitch's argument that has to be true before
any bookkeeping is attempted.

The same step counting supplies the numbers that the Immerman–Szelepcsényi counting argument
compares, so `NLSubsetCoNL` draws on this file too.

## Main results

- `NTM.ReachesCfgIn.trans`, `NTM.ReachesCfgIn.split` — walks concatenate and split
- `NTM.reachesCfgLe_add_iff` — **the midpoint recursion**
- `NTM.reachesCfgLe_two_mul_iff`, `NTM.reachesCfgLe_two_pow_succ_iff` — its halving forms
- `NTM.mem_reachSet_iff_reachesCfgLe` — the rounds of the search are exactly the step bounds
- `NTM.reachesCfg_iff_reachesCfgLe` — every reachable configuration is reachable within the
  number of configuration codes

exactly `s` of them. -/
