# Class membership as an explicit polynomial bound

⚠️ Unreviewed by Bolton

Membership in `PSPACE` is stated asymptotically: some space function that is `O(n^k)`. A machine
under construction needs the opposite — a concrete polynomial it can be checked against, and a
way to hand that polynomial back as a `PSPACE` membership when it is done. The two theorems here
are that exchange, in both directions. The iteration lemma (`SpaceIter.mem_PSPACE_of_iterate`),
Savitch's theorem, and the `PP ⊆ PSPACE` and `PH ⊆ PSPACE` machines pass through them; other
space results in this folder (complement closure, `PSPACE ⊆ EXP`, the `NL` results) work with
the space predicates directly.

## Main results

- `exists_poly_window_of_mem_PSPACE` — a `PSPACE` language with an explicit polynomial window
- `mem_PSPACE_of_polyWindow` — and the converse
- `mem_P_of_polyTime` — the time-domain counterpart, for `P`

/-- **A `PSPACE` language comes with an explicit polynomial window.** Membership in `PSPACE` only
gives an asymptotic bound on some space function; a machine has to be handed a concrete
polynomial, since the window it must respect is a function of the input length it can evaluate. -/

/-- **A machine with an explicit polynomial window decides a `PSPACE` language.** The exact
converse: together the two say that membership in `PSPACE` *is* the existence of a machine
keeping a polynomial window, with no asymptotics left to manage. -/

/-- **A machine with an explicit polynomial time bound decides a `P` language.** The time-domain
counterpart of `mem_PSPACE_of_polyWindow`: a construction hands back a concrete `Polynomial ℕ`
and gets the class membership, with the asymptotics discharged here. -/
