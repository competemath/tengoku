# `coNL ⊆ NL`

⚠️ Unreviewed by Bolton

The reverse half of the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem.

Either inclusion implies the other, and this file proves that reduction unconditionally: `coNL`
is the complement class of `NL`, so complementing both sides of one inclusion produces the other.
Only one direction therefore has to be proved by inductive counting — see `NLSubsetCoNL`.

## Main results

- `coNL_subset_NL_of_NL_subset_coNL`, `NL_subset_coNL_of_coNL_subset_NL` — the two directions are
  equivalent
- `NL_eq_coNL_of_NL_subset_coNL` — either one settles `NL = coNL`
