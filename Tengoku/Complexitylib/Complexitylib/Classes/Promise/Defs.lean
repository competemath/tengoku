# Promise problems -- definitions

A promise problem has disjoint yes- and no-instance languages. Inputs outside
their union are unconstrained. This module keeps semantic solvers, explicit
side-preserving maps, and polynomial-time many-one reductions separate.

Ordinary languages embed as total promise problems with no-instances equal to
the complement. Gap problems should use `PromiseProblem` directly rather than
arbitrarily assigning the gap region to one side.
