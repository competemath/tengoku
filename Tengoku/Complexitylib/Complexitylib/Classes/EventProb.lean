# Finite event probability

The uniform probability of a finite event over `T` random bits, `|E| / 2^T`,
defined once as `eventProb` and related to `Finset.card` and to the existing
rational PTM acceptance probability `NTM.acceptProb`.

## Main results

- `eventProb` with `eventProb_nonneg`, `eventProb_mono`, `eventProb_le_one`, `eventProb_empty`,
  `eventProb_univ`, the complement identity `eventProb_compl`, and the union
  bound `eventProb_union_le`
- `eventProb_le_uniformAverage_div` — finite-uniform Markov inequality
- `eventProb_biUnion`, `eventProb_eq_sum_fiberwise` — finite additivity and the
  conditioning-by-partition identity
- `eventProb_filter_of_constant_fibers`, `eventProb_repeatRandomSeed` — cancel
  uniformly ignored random bits, including the fixed-time repetition schedule
- `eventProb_block` — independence across blocks: a prefix/suffix-separable event's
  probability is the product of the two block probabilities
- `eventProb_blockMajority_eq_false` — the exact weighted binomial tail for
  majority failure across an odd number of independent blocks
- `eventProb_blockMajority_false_le_two_pow` — `12k + 1` independent repetitions
  reduce error from at most `1/3` to at most `1 / 2^k`
- `eventProb_blockMajority_true_ge_one_sub_two_pow`,
  `eventProb_blockMajority_true_le_two_pow` — the corresponding amplified
  yes- and no-instance bounds
- `exists_good_seed_of_sum_eventProb_lt_one`,
  `exists_good_seed_of_eventProb_le_two_pow_succ` — probabilistic-method
  adapters from bad-event bounds to one seed that works on every input
- `NTM.acceptProb_eq_eventProb` — the PTM acceptance probability *is* the event
  probability of its set of accepting choice sequences
- `NTM.traceEventProb_eq_of_le_of_allChoicesHalt` — extending an observation
  clock after every path has halted preserves every event on the final state;
  in particular, acceptance and output probabilities are clock-invariant
- `NTM.acceptProb_eq_eventProb_repeatRandomSeed` — remove administrative random
  bits when a machine's acceptance factors through the compact repetition seed
