# Simulating CSLib multi-tape machines on Complexitylib machines

This file defines a Complexitylib machine (`TM k`) that simulates a binary
CSLib multi-tape machine (`Turing.MultiTapeTM k Bool S`) with the same number
of work tapes. It is the converse direction of
`Complexitylib.Interop.Cslib.MultiTape`.

The simulator bridges the two models as follows.

- **Symbols.** CSLib cells hold `Option Bool`; the blank `none` becomes `□`
  and `some b` becomes the bit `b`.
- **Two-way work tapes.** Each CSLib work tape is folded onto one of our
  one-sided work tapes: CSLib cell `z ≥ 0` lives in our cell `2 z + 1`, and
  CSLib cell `z < 0` in our cell `-2 z`. Our cell `0` (`▷`) is never used. A
  sign flag in the control state records which half the head is on. A CSLib
  head move becomes a move by two cells, or by one cell across the fold; the
  fold is detected by bumping into `▷`.
- **Phases.** Each CSLib step takes three of our steps: phase `0` (`run`)
  reads all heads, applies CSLib's transition, writes, and starts the head
  moves; phases `1` and `2` (`mid1`, `mid2`) finish them.
- **Input head.** Our input head sits on the cell with CSLib's input position:
  cell `0` (`▷`) is CSLib's left blank and cell `|x| + 1` its right blank.
  CSLib clamps moves past either blank. Since our head must leave `▷` at once,
  staying on position `0` is simulated by moving right and then back left.
- **Output.** CSLib emits output symbols one at a time. The simulator writes
  each emitted bit on its output tape and moves right, so the first emitted
  bit (CSLib's verdict) lands in output cell `1`.

## Main definitions

- `Complexity.FromMultiTape.St` — the simulator's states
- `Complexity.FromMultiTape.toTM` — the Complexitylib machine simulating a
  CSLib machine
