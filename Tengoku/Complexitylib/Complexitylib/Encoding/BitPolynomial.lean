# Correct carryless multiplication of binary polynomials

`BitPolynomial.ofBits` interprets a bit list as coefficients over `ZMod 2`,
constant coefficient first. `ofBits_mulBits` proves that the concrete parity
convolution computes polynomial multiplication for every pair of lists,
including empty lists and lists with high zero padding.

The result has length equal to the sum of the input lengths. For nonempty
operands its last coefficient is therefore zero. No normalization or
irreducibility assumption is needed. The uniform polynomial-time certificate
is in `Complexitylib.Classes.P.BitPolynomial`.
