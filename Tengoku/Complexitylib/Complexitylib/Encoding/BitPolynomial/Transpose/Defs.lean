# Transposition of flat binary coefficient matrices

The input is read as a row-major `rows` by `cols` matrix. Transposition
writes exactly `rows * cols` bits in row-major order, reading absent input
bits as false and ignoring bits past the requested rectangle. Zero rows or
columns give the empty list.

For coefficient packing, take `rows = d` source coefficients of width
`cols = b`: input position `j*b+i` becomes output position `i*d+j`.
The runtime evaluator uses `pair (pair bits rowsWord) colsWord`; dimensions
are the lengths of their words, independently of their bit values.
