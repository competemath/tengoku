# Runtime coefficient lists for sparse binary trinomials

The list `trinomialBits d` has true coefficients at positions `0`, `d`, and
`2*d`, representing `X^(2*d) + X^d + 1` over the two-element field. The
definition is total at `d = 0`: all three positions coincide, and their sum
is still one in characteristic two. The evaluator takes `d` in unary as the
length of its input; the input bit values are ignored.
