# Horner evaluation of flat binary coefficient blocks

Block `j` consists of at most `width` bits beginning at `j*width`, with absent
bits interpreted as zero by the polynomial codec. Blocks occur in increasing
polynomial degree. The count-list fold processes them from highest to lowest
using the index `total - tail.length - 1`.

Every state has the modulus degree in bits. A zero modulus explicitly gives
an empty state, and a zero count starts from the zero polynomial. The encoded
evaluator reads `pair (pair (pair coeffs widthWord) (pair seed modulus)) count`;
width and count are the lengths of their runtime words.
