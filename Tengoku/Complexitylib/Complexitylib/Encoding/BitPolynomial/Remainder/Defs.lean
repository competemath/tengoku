# Long division of binary coefficient lists

`significantLength` discards high zero padding numerically: it is one past the
highest true coefficient, or zero for the zero polynomial. Every nonzero
binary polynomial is monic, independently of its list's high zero padding.

For a modulus of degree `d`, `remainderScan` processes the dividend from its
highest coefficient to its constant coefficient, keeping exactly `d` bits.
Each step shifts the current remainder, inserts the next coefficient, and
cancels the possible degree-`d` term with the supplied modulus. Constant-one
moduli have `d = 0` and produce the empty list.

`remainderBits` returns its dividend unchanged for a zero modulus, agreeing
with Mathlib's convention for remainder by a nonmonic zero polynomial. Both
operands are runtime inputs, and every definition is total.
