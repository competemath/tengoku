# Correct padded binary-polynomial addition

The concrete coefficientwise XOR represents addition over `ZMod 2` for all
input lists, including empty operands and high zero padding. Its exact
length is the larger operand length. A uniform polynomial-time certificate
is supplied by `Complexitylib.Classes.P.BitPolynomial.Addition`.
