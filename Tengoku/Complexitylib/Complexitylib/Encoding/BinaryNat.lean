# Canonical variable-width binary natural-number codes

This module packages `Nat.bits` as a canonical binary code for natural
numbers. Bits are ordered least-significant first, and redundant high zeroes
are rejected. In particular, zero has the unique empty code.

Unlike a prefix code, this representation relies on an enclosing framing
layer to determine the field boundary. `Complexitylib.Encoding.Pairing`
provides that framing for variable-length machine inputs.
