# Harmonic means and coordinate projections

Definitions for Section 4 of Oliver Korten, *Top-Down Lower Bounds for All
Depths*, ECCC TR26-221 (2026), https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2026/221/.

The harmonic mean is zero if any value is zero. This implements the paper's
extended-real convention without using the real-number convention `0⁻¹ = 0`
inside the average. Theorems assume nonnegative inputs.

A coordinate set is its Boolean membership function. Projections are represented
on the full cube: their value depends only on the selected coordinates. Averaging
on the full cube gives each projected pattern the same multiplicity, so this is
the uniform average over projected patterns. All expectations are finite sums.
