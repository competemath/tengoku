# Conditional sampling inside a coordinate union

Let `P` and `Q` be independent Bernoulli masks with rates `p` and `q`.
Their union has rate `p + q - p*q`. Conditional on that union `S`, the mask
`P \ Q` has independent coordinates inside `S`, with rate
`r = p*(1-q)/(p+q-p*q)`. The theorems express this law as equality of finite
expectations, avoiding conditioning on zero-probability events.

This is the coordinate-sampling step in Oliver Korten's mirror-set proof,
