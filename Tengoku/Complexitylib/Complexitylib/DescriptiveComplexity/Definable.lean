# First-order definable queries

A Boolean query is **first-order definable** when some FO sentence defines it. The
central fact of descriptive complexity — that a logic can only define
"legitimate" (order-independent) queries — is recorded here for first-order logic:
every FO-definable query is order-independent (`FODefinable.orderIndependent`, a
packaging of Immerman Proposition 1.16). Since FO has `¬`, `∧`, `∨`, the
FO-definable queries are closed under complement, intersection, and union.

This is the template for the planned logic/complexity correspondences: a class
of logics defines a class of queries, and expressibility questions become lower
bounds.

## Main definitions and results

- `DescriptiveComplexity.FODefinable` — first-order definability of a query.
- `DescriptiveComplexity.FODefinable.orderIndependent` — FO-definable ⟹
  order-independent.
- `FODefinable.complement`, `.inter`, `.union` — Boolean closure.
- `FODefinable.of_reduces`, `.of_projReduces` — closure under first-order
  reductions and projections.
- `FODefinable.toSODefinable` — `FO ⊆ SO` at the query level.
