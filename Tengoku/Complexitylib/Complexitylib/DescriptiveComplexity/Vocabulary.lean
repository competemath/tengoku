  # Vocabularies (Signatures)

  Following Immerman's "Descriptive Complexity", a vocabulary (also called a
  signature) is a tuple of relation symbols with arities, plus constant symbols.
  We represent this finitely: `numRels` relation symbols with arities given by
  `relArity`, and `numConsts` constant symbols.

    with specified arities and finitely many constant symbols. -/

  /-- Number of relation symbols -/

/-- The vocabulary used for binary-string examples. Despite its legacy name, it
    is exactly `ofRel 1`: one unary relation `S` (the "1-bit" predicate) and no
    order, successor, or constant symbols. `Vocabulary.withOrder` in the
    `Numerical` module adds a strict order. -/
