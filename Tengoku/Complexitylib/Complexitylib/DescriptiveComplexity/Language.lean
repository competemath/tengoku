# The language induced by a Boolean query

The bridge from descriptive complexity to the machine model: a Boolean query over
finite structures induces a **language** (a set of bit strings) — the encodings of
the structures satisfying it. This is where a logical characterization of a query
becomes a statement about a machine-model `Language`, the connection Fagin's
theorem (`NP = ∃SO`) and the other planned logic/complexity correspondences
ultimately rest on.

## Main definitions and results

- `DescriptiveComplexity.queryLanguage` — the language of a query.
- `DescriptiveComplexity.mem_queryLanguage` — a `Q`-satisfying structure's encoding
  is in `Q`'s language.
- `mem_queryLanguage_iff_decodeStruct` — exact membership via successful decoding.
- `encodeStruct_mem_queryLanguage_iff` — encoding preserves and reflects the query.
- `not_mem_queryLanguage_of_decodeStruct_eq_none` — malformed inputs are rejected.
