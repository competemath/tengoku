# Finite observations of space-bounded transducer configurations

This file defines the finite snapshots used to turn an auxiliary-space bound
for a deterministic transducer into a time bound. A work tape whose head stays
within `space` is observed only through that bounded head position and the
cells through `space`. The input is read-only, so its head position suffices.
For the one-way output tape, only whether the head is at the left marker and
the symbol currently under the head can affect future execution.

## Main definitions

- `Tape.BoundedObs` — the finite observable part of a space-bounded tape
- `Tape.boundedObs` — observe a tape whose head satisfies the space bound
- `TM.TransducerSnapshot` — the finite observable part of a transducer configuration
- `TM.transducerSnapshot` — observe a configuration within auxiliary space
- `TM.transducerConfigBound` — the number of possible transducer snapshots

namespace TM

/-- The finite observable part of a space-bounded transducer configuration.

The output position and written prefix are deliberately absent: for a one-way
output tape, future execution can inspect only whether the head is still on
the exceptional left-marker cell and the symbol under its current head. -/

bound. The output-head zero flag distinguishes the immutable left-marker cell
from ordinary output cells. -/

/-- The number of finite snapshots of a `k`-work-tape transducer using auxiliary
space `space` on inputs of length `inputLength`: exactly the cardinality of
`TM.TransducerSnapshot` (`card_transducerSnapshot`), and hence an upper bound on
the number of distinct snapshots a run can visit. -/
