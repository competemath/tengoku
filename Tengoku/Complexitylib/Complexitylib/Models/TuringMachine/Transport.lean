# Exact configuration transport

Successful-step preservation transports exact runs without changing their duration.
The stronger equality of optional steps also reflects every reachable configuration
from an embedded start. The distinction matters: a controller may continue after a
child halts, whereas a tape-layout embedding reflects the child's halt as well.

No injectivity, halting-time bound, or tape invariant is assumed implicitly.

may carry a source invariant and an evolving extra-tape frame; both remain explicit in
the caller's one-step obligation. No halt reflection or injectivity is required. -/
