# The converse direction of Barrington's theorem

Polynomial-length width-`5` permutation branching programs are evaluated by
balanced Boolean formulas of logarithmic depth. Together with the existing
formula-to-program construction, this proves the full nonuniform Barrington
equivalence under the library's total-assignment family convention.

## Main results

- `BP.eval_reachesFormula` -- correctness of balanced state-to-state evaluation
- `BP.depth_reachesFormula_le` -- depth at most `(w + 1) * d + 1`
- `BP.eval_decisionFormula_eq_true` -- the decision formula detects movement
- `BP.depth_decisionFormula_le` -- logarithmic depth in program length
- `BP.vars_decisionFormula_lt` -- conversion preserves an arity bound
- `BPFamily.toFormulaFamily_logDepth` -- polynomial-length families give
  logarithmic-depth formula families
- `barrington_equivalence_onTotalAssignments` -- the explicitly named
  total-assignment equivalence
