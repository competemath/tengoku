# Barrington's theorem (representation form)

Assembling the three preceding modules — the abstract move-set
(`Circuits/Barrington.lean`), the `S₅` cycle algebra
(`Circuits/BarringtonS5.lean`), and the width-`5` bridge
(`Circuits/BarringtonBridge.lean`) — this module proves the semantic core of
Barrington's theorem by structural recursion on Boolean formulas: **every Boolean
formula is computed by a width-`5` permutation branching program**, in the sense
that the program evaluates to a fixed nonidentity permutation of `S₅` exactly when
the formula is true and to the identity otherwise.

The recursion follows the connectives directly:
`var`/`tru`/`fls` are the base cases; `neg` flips the target cycle to its inverse;
`conj` is the target-free `AND` gate `BP.Computes_and5`; and `disj` is De Morgan
composed of `AND` and negation. Each step preserves representation through a
genuine `5`-cycle, which is what the commutator-trick `AND` requires.

The length bookkeeping lives in `Circuits/BarringtonLength.lean`, where
length-preserving pointwise conjugation and compact negation sharpen this
semantic recursion to the textbook `4^d` bound. The nonuniform family lift and
converse live in `BarringtonFamily.lean` and `BarringtonConverse.lean`.

## Main results

- `Complexity.Computes_formula` — every formula is representable through any
  chosen `5`-cycle target.
- `Complexity.barrington_representation` — Barrington's theorem, representation
  form: a width-`5` program and a nonidentity `σ ∈ S₅` with `eval = σ ↔ φ` true.
- `Complexity.barrington_boolean` — the Boolean-decision form: a width-`5` program
  and a query point `x` whose orbit under the program's value decides `φ`.

/-- **Formula representability.** For every Boolean formula `φ` and every target
    `5`-cycle `c` of `S₅`, there is a width-`5` permutation branching program that
    represents `φ` through `c` — evaluating to `c` when `φ` is true and to the
    identity otherwise. Proved by structural recursion on `φ` using the bridged
    Barrington moves. -/

    and a nonidentity permutation `σ ∈ S₅` such that `r` evaluates to `σ` exactly

    `finRotate 5`.) -/

/-- **Barrington's theorem (Boolean-decision form).** Every Boolean formula `φ` is
    decided by a width-`5` permutation branching program: there is a program `r`
    and a query point `x ∈ Fin 5` such that the program's value moves `x` exactly

    turning the permutation-valued representation into a genuine Boolean output.
    (The point `x` is any point the representing cycle `σ` moves; `σ ≠ 1`
    guarantees one exists.) -/
