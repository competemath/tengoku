# Quadratic forms over `GF(2)` and their ranks -- definitions

The hard functions of the correlation bounds are quadratic forms over the field with two
elements. An input `x : ι → Bool` is read coordinatewise as a vector over `ZMod 2`
(`Correlation.bit`), and a square matrix `Q` defines the Boolean function
`x ↦ ∑ i, ∑ j, Q i j x_i x_j` (`Correlation.quadForm`). Only the polar matrix `Q + Qᵀ`
matters for correlation with circuits: cutting the coordinates into `U` and `Uᶜ`, the form
is a function of the `U`-part, plus a function of the `Uᶜ`-part, plus the bilinear pairing
of the two parts through the block of `Q + Qᵀ` with rows `U` and columns `Uᶜ`. The rank of
that block is the *cut rank* of `Q` at `U` (`Correlation.cutRank`).

Ranks of blocks are the dimension over `ZMod 2` of the span of their rows
(`Correlation.blockRank`); this needs no `Fintype` instance on the index sets. A matrix is
*submatrix-robust* with deficiency `t` (`Correlation.SubmatrixRobust`) when every square
block with `k` rows has rank at least `k - t`.

The explicit family is a bilinear form `xᵀ R y` (`Correlation.bilinForm`): on inputs of
length `n` the left half `x` consists of the first `⌊n/2⌋` coordinates, the right half `y`
of the next `⌊n/2⌋`, and for odd `n` the last coordinate is ignored.

## Main definitions

* `Correlation.bit`, `Correlation.quadForm`: a quadratic form as a Boolean function.
* `Correlation.blockRank`, `Correlation.cutRank`: ranks of blocks and cut ranks.
* `Correlation.SubmatrixRobust`: every square block is nearly of full rank.
* `Correlation.leftIdx`, `Correlation.rightIdx`, `Correlation.bilinForm`: the bilinear
  form `xᵀ R y` on inputs of length `n`.
