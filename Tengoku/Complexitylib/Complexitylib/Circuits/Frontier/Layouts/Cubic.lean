# Layouts of cubic graphs

The graph-theoretic input to the lower bound is a layout bound for subcubic multigraphs,
`Frontier.LayoutBound 3 A`. Compressing a subcubic multigraph to its cubic core reduces it to
laying out simple cubic graphs (`Frontier.Layouts.Compression`).

`CubicLayoutBound c` says that for every `ξ > 0`, every sufficiently large simple cubic graph on
`h` vertices has a layout, given as an injective vertex key, all of whose prefixes are crossed by
at most `(c + ξ) h + 2` edges. A cubic graph on `h` vertices has cycle rank `h/2 + 1`, which is
why a cubic coefficient `c` becomes the layout coefficient `2c`.
