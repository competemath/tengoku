# From cubic graphs to subcubic multigraphs

This file proves `LayoutBound.of_cubic`: a layout bound for simple cubic graphs with
coefficient `c` (`CubicLayoutBound c`) gives the layout bound for connected multigraphs of
maximum degree three with coefficient `2c`. Throughout, `G` has `N` vertices, `M` edges, and
cycle rank `β₁ = M - N + 1`.

**Compression.** Partition the vertices of `G` into *blocks*, each listing its vertices in
order, starting from single vertices. Two distinct blocks joined by an edge are *merged* when
their union still has at most three edges leaving it, as happens when one of them has at most
two edges leaving it or when two edges join them. The merged block lists the longer block first.
A `Compression` records the invariants of this process:

* at most three edges leave a block;
* at most `3 log₂ |B|` edges leave a proper prefix of a block `B`. A proper prefix of a merged
  block is a proper prefix of its first part, or all of its first part followed by a proper
  prefix of its second part, which has at most half as many vertices;
* there are at least as many blocks and edges inside blocks as vertices, since a merge loses
  one block and moves at least one edge inside.

Each merge loses a block, so merging ends in a *final* compression (`exists_final`).

**The quotient.** In a final compression two distinct blocks are joined by at most one edge,
and if there are at least two blocks then exactly three edges leave each block: by
connectivity, a block with fewer would merge with a neighbor. So the `quotient`, the graph on
the blocks in which two blocks are adjacent when an edge joins them, is a simple cubic graph
(`isRegularOfDegree`). Its `h` vertices span `3h/2` edges, which are the edges of `G` between
blocks, and the counting invariant gives `h + 2N ≤ 2M` (`card_add_two_mul_le`). So the quotient
has at most `2 β₁` vertices.

**Expansion.** Lay out `G` block by block, ordering the blocks by a layout of the quotient and
each block by its list. A frontier consists of whole blocks followed by a prefix of one more
block. The edges leaving the whole blocks are edges of the quotient crossing its frontier
(`ncard_cut_le`), and at most `3 log₂ N + 3` edges leave the prefix (`exists_layout`).

**The bound.** Given `η > 0`, take the cubic bound with slack `ξ = η/2`. A quotient on `h > N₀`
vertices has a layout whose frontiers have at most `(c + ξ) h + 2 ≤ (2c + η) β₁ + 2` edges, and
a quotient on at most `N₀ + 1` vertices has at most `(N₀ + 1) N₀ / 2` edges. So every frontier
of `G` has at most `(2c + η) β₁ + 3 log₂ N + C` edges, for a constant `C`, and
`3 log₂ N ≤ η N + C'` (`exists_log_le_mul_add`).

The compression structure, merging, quotient, and expansion also work at any boundary
budget `d`. `QuarticCompression` supplies the terminal-core argument at degree four.

## Main definitions

* `Frontier.Multigraph.Compression`: a partition into ordered blocks, with its invariants.
* `Frontier.Multigraph.Compression.Final`: no merge applies.
* `Frontier.Multigraph.Compression.quotient`: the simple graph on the blocks.

## Main results

* `Frontier.Multigraph.Compression.exists_final`: merging terminates.
* `Frontier.Multigraph.Compression.isRegularOfDegree`: the quotient is cubic.
* `Frontier.Multigraph.Compression.card_add_two_mul_le`: the quotient is small.
* `Frontier.Multigraph.Compression.exists_layout`: expanding a layout of the quotient.
* `Frontier.LayoutBound.of_cubic`: the layout bound.
