# Sweeps and the frontier counting lemma

A *sweep* of a set of inputs `S ⊆ U^ι` reveals the coordinates of an input a few at a time:
`∅ = X 0, X 1, ..., X T = ι`. At each time `t` an input has a *message* `μ t x`, which may
depend on the whole input. The defining property is that messages permit splicing:
if two inputs of `S` have the same message at time `t`, then
the revealed part of one may be spliced onto the unrevealed part of the other without leaving
`S`. The last message, sent once everything is revealed, carries no information.

Between times `t` and `t + 1` an input `x` takes the *transition*
`(μ t x, μ (t + 1) x, x|_{X (t + 1) \ X t})`: the message before the step, the message after
it, and the coordinates revealed during it.

**The frontier counting lemma** (`Sweep.ncard_le`). If `S` is `K`-rectangle-free and has at
least `K` elements, then
`|S| ≤ (K - 1) ^ 2 · ∑_t #{transitions taken at step t}`.

The proof charges each input `x` to the first time `t + 1` at which the inputs sharing its
message have at least `K` distinct revealed parts. Their rectangular hull lies inside `S`, so
they have fewer than `K` distinct unrevealed parts. At time `t` the inputs sharing the message
of `x` still had fewer than `K` distinct revealed parts. An input charged to a step is
determined by its transition, its part revealed by time `t`, and its part unrevealed at time
`t + 1`; hence at most `(K - 1) ^ 2` inputs share a charged step and a transition.

Nothing here mentions graphs or circuits: a sweep is an abstract family of splicing messages.
Its transitions alone need not form a correct branching program.
Constraint networks swept along a vertex ordering produce sweeps whose messages are the values
on the edges of the frontier (`Frontier.Network.sweep`).

## Main definitions

* `Frontier.Sweep S M`: a sweep of `S` with messages in `M`.
* `Frontier.Sweep.transition`: the transition taken by an input at a step.

## Main results

* `Frontier.Sweep.ncard_le`: the frontier counting lemma.
