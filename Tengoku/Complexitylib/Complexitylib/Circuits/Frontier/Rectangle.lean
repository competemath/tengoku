# Rectangles and rectangle-free sets

An *input* is a function `x : ι → U` from a type of coordinates to an alphabet. A set of
coordinates `X` cuts an input into two *parts*: its restriction to `X` and its restriction
to the complement `X^c`. The *rectangle* with sides `A` and `B` is the set of inputs whose
part on `X` lies in `A` and whose part on `X^c` lies in `B`.

A set of inputs `S` is `K`-*rectangle-free* when every rectangle inside `S`, for every way of
cutting the coordinates, has a side with fewer than `K` elements. This is the only property of
the hard function that the lower bound uses.

The *support lemma* `RectangleFree.pow_ncard_compl_lt` is the only other fact we need about
such sets: a large rectangle-free set depends on all but fewer than `log_|U| K` coordinates.
Indeed, if `S` ignored a set `D` of `log_|U| K` coordinates, then `S` would contain the
rectangle whose side on `D` is everything, so its other side, and hence `S`, would be small.

## Main definitions

* `Frontier.rectangle X A B`: the rectangle with sides `A` on `X` and `B` on `X^c`.
* `Frontier.RectangleFree S K`: every rectangle inside `S` has a side with fewer than `K`
  elements.

## Main results

* `Frontier.RectangleFree.ncard_le_of_dependsOn`: a rectangle-free set that ignores the
  coordinates in `D`, with `K ≤ |U| ^ |D|`, has at most `|U| ^ |D| * (K - 1)` elements.
* `Frontier.RectangleFree.pow_ncard_compl_lt`: the support lemma.
