# Spira's formula-balancing theorem

Every Boolean formula has an equivalent formula of logarithmic depth and
polynomial tree size. The quantitative statement below uses the existing
total-node measure: a source formula of size `s` has an equivalent formula of
depth at most `15 + 12 * clog₂(s)` and size at most `80 * s ^ 8 - 4`.

The construction balances arbitrary formulas, including nested negations. It
does not assume a uniform circuit generator: this is a finite, nonuniform
transformation.

## Main result

* `BoolFormula.exists_spira_balanced` -- an equivalent logarithmic-depth,
  polynomial-size Boolean formula.

/-- **Spira's balancing theorem.** Every Boolean formula has an equivalent
formula with logarithmic depth and polynomial tree size. The constants and
degree are explicit so downstream family-level theorems need no hidden
asymptotic reasoning. -/
