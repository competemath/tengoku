/-! # Valiant's Depth Reduction Lemma

The **length** of a directed path is the number of nodes in it. The
**depth** of a finite directed graph is the length of a longest simple path.

**Lemma** (Valiant, 1977). *In any acyclic directed graph with `S` edges and
depth `d = 2 ^ k`, for any `1 ≤ r ≤ k`, it is possible to remove
`r * S / k` edges so that the depth of the resulting graph does not
exceed `d / 2 ^ r`.*

Reference: L. G. Valiant, *Graph-theoretic arguments in low-level
complexity*, MFCS 1977. Stated as Lemma 1.4 in Jukna, *Boolean
Function Complexity*.

The theorem states acyclicity explicitly. This is the circuit-relevant case
and prevents a bounded-depth hypothesis from hiding a directed cycle.

The proof machinery — canonical labelings, the edge partition by
first-differing bit, averaging, and the relabeling-after-removal
bound — lives in `Complexitylib.Circuits.Internal.Valiant`.

/-- **Valiant's Depth Reduction Lemma** (Valiant, 1977).

In any finite acyclic directed graph `G` with `S` edges and depth at most
`2 ^ k`, for any `r ≤ k`, there exists a set `F` of edges such
that:

* `F` is a subset of the edge set,
* `k * F.card ≤ r * S` (equivalent to `|F| ≤ r * S / k` without
  integer division), and
* after removing `F`, the resulting digraph has depth at most
  `2 ^ k / 2 ^ r`.

The explicit acyclicity hypothesis matches the DAG setting in which Jukna's
canonical-labeling argument applies. -/
