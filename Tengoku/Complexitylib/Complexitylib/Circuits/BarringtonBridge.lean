# Barrington: bridging the abstract move-set to the `S₅` cycle algebra

`Circuits/Barrington.lean` develops the width-`w` representation predicate
`BP.Computes` and its closure moves (conjugation, negation, the commutator-trick
`AND`, `OR`). `Circuits/BarringtonS5.lean` proves the group-theoretic `S₅` input:
every `5`-cycle is the commutator of two `5`-cycles. This module joins the two,
specializing to width `5`, to obtain the moves in the form Barrington's induction
actually consumes — where the *target* representing cycle is an arbitrary
`5`-cycle rather than whatever the subprograms happened to produce.

## Main results

- `Complexity.BP.Computes_retarget` — a program representing `f` through one
  `5`-cycle can be rebuilt to represent `f` through *any* chosen `5`-cycle
  (`5`-cycles are conjugate, and pointwise conjugation preserves length).
- `Complexity.BP.Computes_retarget_length` — the retargeted program has exactly
  the original length.
- `Complexity.BP.Computes_and5` — given subprograms representing `f` and `g`
  through `5`-cycles, `f ∧ g` is representable through *any* target `5`-cycle.
  This is Barrington's `AND` gate with full target-cycle freedom, the exact shape
  the formula induction needs.

    `5`-cycle `a` there is a program representing `f` through `a`. (The two
    `5`-cycles are conjugate — `isConj_iff_cycleType_eq` — and pointwise
    conjugation changes the representing permutation without adding
    instructions.) -/

/-- **Barrington's `AND` gate, with target-cycle freedom.** Given subprograms
    representing `f` and `g` each through some `5`-cycle, and any chosen target
    `5`-cycle `c`, there is a program representing `f ∧ g` through `c`.

    Proof: `c = ⁅a, b⁆` for `5`-cycles `a, b` (`every_fiveCycle_is_commutator`);
    retarget the two subprograms to `a` and `b`; the commutator trick
    (`BP.Computes_and`) then represents `f ∧ g` through `⁅a, b⁆ = c`. -/
