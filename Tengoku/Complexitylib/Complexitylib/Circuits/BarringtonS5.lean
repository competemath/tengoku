# The `S₅` five-cycle commutator (Barrington's non-solvability input)

Barrington's theorem needs a specific algebraic fact about the symmetric group
`S₅ = Equiv.Perm (Fin 5)`: there are two `5`-cycles whose commutator is again a
`5`-cycle. This is precisely the failure of solvability of `S₅` that lets the
commutator-trick `AND` gate (`Circuits/Barrington.lean`, `BP.Computes_and`) hit a
genuine `5`-cycle target, so the inductive construction can be conjugated to any
desired output cycle.

We exhibit an explicit witness — `a = finRotate 5` and the `5`-cycle
`b = (0 2 4 3 1)` — and verify by kernel computation (`decide`, hence **no**
`native_decide` and no extra axioms) that `a`, `b`, and `⁅a, b⁆` each have order
`5`. Order `5` (a prime) together with a nonidentity element forces a single
cycle via `Equiv.Perm.isCycle_of_prime_order`.

Conjugation upgrades the single witness to *every* `5`-cycle: since the `5`-cycles
form one conjugacy class of `S₅` and conjugation distributes over commutators, any
`5`-cycle is the commutator of two `5`-cycles (`every_fiveCycle_is_commutator`).
That is the form Barrington's induction consumes — it may target an arbitrary
output cycle.

## Main results

- `Complexity.isCycle_orderOf_five_of_pow` — a nonidentity `g : S₅` with `g⁵ = 1`
  is a `5`-cycle of order `5`.
- `Complexity.conj_isCycle_orderOf_five` — a conjugate of a `5`-cycle is a
  `5`-cycle.
- `Complexity.exists_fiveCycle_commutator` — two `5`-cycles of `S₅` whose
  commutator is again a `5`-cycle.
- `Complexity.every_fiveCycle_is_commutator` — *every* `5`-cycle of `S₅` is the
  commutator of two `5`-cycles.

/-- A nonidentity permutation of `Fin 5` whose fifth power is the identity is a
    `5`-cycle of order `5`. (Order divides the prime `5` and is not `1`, so it is
    `5`; a prime-order permutation is a single cycle.) -/

    `g⁵ = 1` — via the homomorphism `MulAut.conj` — and nonidentity, so
    `isCycle_orderOf_five_of_pow` applies to the conjugate.) -/

    commutator is again a `5`-cycle. The explicit witnesses are `finRotate 5` and
    the `5`-cycle `(0 2 4 3 1)`; the order-`5` facts are checked by kernel

    witness `exists_fiveCycle_commutator` with the fact that the `5`-cycles form a
    single conjugacy class of `S₅` (equal cycle type ⟹ conjugate) and that
    conjugation distributes over the commutator, any `5`-cycle `c` of `S₅` can be
    written as `⁅a, b⁆` for `5`-cycles `a, b`. This is the target-cycle freedom
    Barrington's `AND` gate needs. -/
