# Barrington for log-depth formula families: polynomial-length width-`5` programs

`Circuits/BarringtonLength.lean` proves the textbook per-formula bound
`barrington_representation_depth_four` (a formula of depth `d` compiles to a
width-`5` program of length `≤ 4^d`). This module lifts that to *families*: a
family of formulas of logarithmic depth is computed, formula by formula, by a
family of width-`5` permutation branching programs of **polynomial** length.
That is the polynomial-size direction of Barrington's characterization, in the
nonuniform (per-length) setting, for untyped `FormulaFamily` syntax
(`ℕ → BoolFormula`). It is not stated for the library's `NC1` class; the
class-level results are `NC1_subset_Width5BP` (in
`Circuits/CircuitFormula/Family.lean`) and `barrington_equivalence`.

The families here range over the same `ℕ → Bool` assignments the Barrington
development already uses, so `FormulaFamily.logDepth_polyLength_bp` follows by
applying the per-formula bound pointwise, together with the arithmetic fact that
`4^{c·log₂ n + c}` is bounded by a polynomial in `n`.

## Main definitions and results

- `FormulaFamily`, `FormulaFamily.LogDepth` — a family of Boolean formulas and the
  logarithmic-depth (`NC¹`) regime.
- `four_pow_logDepth_le_poly` — the reusable arithmetic conversion from
  logarithmic depth to a polynomial `4 ^ depth` bound.
- `FormulaFamily.logDepth_polyLength_bp` — the family-level containment.
