# Multilinear extension (one variable)

The one-variable **multilinear extension** of a Boolean-indexed value into a
commutative ring, `mle₁ f x = f false · (1 - x) + f true · x`, and its defining
interpolation identities at the Boolean points `0` and `1` (toward
arithmetization and the sum-check protocol). This is the atomic building
block of the multilinear extension of a full Boolean function, and the reason
arithmetized formulas agree with their Boolean originals on the cube.

## Main results

- `mle₁` — the one-variable multilinear interpolant
- `mle₁_zero`, `mle₁_one` — it recovers `f false` at `0` and `f true` at `1`
- `mle₁_bool` — it agrees with `f` at both Boolean points
