# The converse direction of Barrington's theorem -- definitions

This file defines balanced Boolean formulas for evaluating permutation branching
programs. A depth parameter `d` describes a block of at most `2 ^ d`
instructions. Two half-blocks are composed by existentially selecting their
intermediate state.

It also fixes the semantic family classes used by the nonuniform Barrington
equivalence. They follow the existing Barrington convention: formulas and
programs are evaluated on total assignments `ℕ → Bool`, while the family index
records the input-length parameter controlling depth and program length.
