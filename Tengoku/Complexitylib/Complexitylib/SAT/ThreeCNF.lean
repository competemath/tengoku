# 3-CNF formulas

The **3-CNF** refinement of the existing `CNF` type: a CNF is in 3-CNF when every
clause has exactly three literals. 3-CNF is
introduced here as a *predicate* on the existing `CNF = List Clause`, so that all
of the `CNF` semantics (`CNF.eval`, `CNF.Satisfiable`, `CNF.maxVar`, renaming)
apply unchanged and a 3-CNF is literally a CNF.

## Main definitions and results

- `CNF.Is3CNF` — every clause has length `3`; decidable
- `CNF.is3CNF_cons` — the cons characterization
- `CNF.Is3CNF.mapVar` — variable renaming preserves the 3-CNF shape

The substantive N3 milestone — a size-controlled clause-padding transformation
turning an arbitrary CNF into an equisatisfiable 3-CNF — builds on this predicate
and is tracked separately.

/-! ### Padding short clauses to width three

A clause with one or two literals is padded to exactly three literals by
repeating its last literal. This changes neither the clause's models nor its
satisfiability (repeating a literal in a disjunction is idempotent), and turns a
CNF whose clauses all have width `1 … 3` into an equivalent 3-CNF. Splitting
*wide* clauses (width `> 3`) needs fresh Tseitin variables and is tracked
separately. -/

    clauses of any other width are left unchanged. -/
