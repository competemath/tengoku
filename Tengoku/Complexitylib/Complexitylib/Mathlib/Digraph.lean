/-! # Digraph extensions for Mathlib

General-purpose definitions on top of Mathlib's `Digraph`: directed walks
and simple paths, `depth` (longest simple-path length on a finite graph),
`IsAcyclic`, the `edgeFinset` of a digraph with decidable adjacency on a
finite vertex type, and `deleteEdges`.

The `depth` measure is exported together with its general bounds, public for
downstream reuse and as upstreaming candidates: `pathLength_bddAbove`
(simple-path lengths are bounded by the vertex count), `depth_le_card`
(`depth ≤ Fintype.card V`), `one_le_depth` (a nonempty graph has positive
depth), and `depth_deleteEdges_empty` (deleting the empty edge set preserves
depth). These hold for every finite digraph, with no acyclicity assumption.

This file lives in `Complexitylib/Mathlib/` because it extends a Mathlib
type in its home (root) namespace — the one sanctioned exception to the
`Complexity` root-namespace rule. Its contents are candidates for
upstreaming to Mathlib.

Depth-reduction-specific machinery (canonical labeling, acyclicity
arguments, edge partitions by first-differing bit, etc.) lives in
`Complexitylib.Circuits.Internal.Valiant`.

/-- The **depth** of a finite digraph is the maximum length — number of
vertices — of a simple directed path. Using simple paths makes `depth` a
total, honest finite measure even when the graph contains a cycle. Results
whose proofs require a DAG state `IsAcyclic` explicitly. -/
-- The instance restricts the definition's domain to finite graphs; the
-- supremum expression itself does not inspect the chosen enumeration.
