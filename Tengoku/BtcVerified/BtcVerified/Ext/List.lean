  # `List` extensions: `zipWith` against a binary constructor and its projections

  Extension lemmas for the dependency-defined `List`, added in `namespace List`.
  They are general facts about recombining a list through a two-argument
  constructor `mk` and its projections `f`, `g`: they hold for *any* such
  triple — pairs, custom two-field structures, anything where `mk` and the
  projections round-trip — not for any particular type. Bitcoin's SegWit codec
  uses them to unzip a list of input/witness pairs into the two separate wire
  regions and zip it back, but nothing here mentions transactions.
