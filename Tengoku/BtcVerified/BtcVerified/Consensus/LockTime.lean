  # Absolute transaction lock time

  The consensus reading of the raw `TxBody.lockTime` wire field. The field is
  zero when disabled; otherwise values below `lockTimeThreshold` name an
  absolute block height and values at or above it name an absolute UNIX time
  ([Bitcoin Core v28.0, `IsFinalTx`, `tx_verify.cpp` lines
  17–37](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v28.0/src/consensus/tx_verify.cpp#L17-L37)).

  Keeping this interpretation as an algebraic data type makes the selected
  axis structural in the reasoning model instead of repeating Core's nested
  numeric conditional in every rule. The wire object remains `UInt32`, and
  `LockTime.ofUInt32` is the explicit boundary between syntax and semantics.

  This type describes the transaction's absolute `nLockTime`. BIP68 relative
  lock times are a separate interpretation of each input's sequence field and
  remain the sequence-locks leaf tracked by #46 ([Bitcoin Core v28.0,
  `CalculateSequenceLocks`, `tx_verify.cpp` lines
  39–109](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v28.0/src/consensus/tx_verify.cpp#L39-L109)).
