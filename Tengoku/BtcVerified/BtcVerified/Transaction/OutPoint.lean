  # Outpoints

  An outpoint names the output a transaction input spends: the funding
  transaction's txid together with the output's index within it. The codec is
  the product of the field codecs in wire order, so both laws come by
  composition (`Codec.ofEquiv` over the product codec) with no hand-written
  proofs — the pattern every plain-product structure in the data model
  follows.
