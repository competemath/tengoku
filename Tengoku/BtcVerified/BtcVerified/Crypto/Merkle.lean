  # Bitcoin's merkle tree

  The merkle root is how a block header commits to its transaction list:
  leaves are txids, and each node is the double-SHA-256 of its two children's
  digests. Bitcoin pads an odd level by hashing its last node with itself —
  and that padding rule makes the construction famously non-injective
  (CVE-2012-2459): a list that materializes part of its own padding as actual
  content produces the same root as the shorter list it extends. So a consensus
  rule must demand more than root equality; that extra requirement,
  *canonicality*, is factored apart here as a first-class, decidable property of
  the leaf list.

  The spec is structural rather than procedural: `Tree` is built top-down by
  bisection at the enclosing power of two, and procedural duplication is an
  explicit constructor (`pad`, semantically a node with two equal children)
  instead of an artifact of iteration order.

  Canonicality constrains exactly what threatens the root's binding and nothing
  more. Padding only ever duplicates trailing power-of-two-aligned blocks —
  the right spine — so a cross-length collision requires a trailing block
  duplicating its left sibling, and `Canonical` forbids precisely that
  (`Tree.spineCanonical`, root node exempt: a shorter list with the same
  enclosing width must still split at the root).

  Collision resistance is never assumed: theorems conclude with
  `Sha256.Collision` — two concrete colliding byte strings — as a
  constructed disjunct, and intractability is the consumer's hypothesis.

  Known residual, documented not solved: equal *widths* are a hypothesis of
  `root_binding_of_canonical`. Across widths, a 64-byte transaction whose
  serialization equals the concatenation of two digests confuses a leaf with
  an internal node (the SPV-grade ambiguity the Great Consensus Cleanup
  proposes to close by forbidding 64-byte transactions). For block validity
  the transaction count is in hand, so the hypothesis is free.

  Checked claims:

  * `root_binding_of_length_eq`: between equal-length lists, the root identifies
    the list — or two concrete byte strings collide under double-SHA-256.
  * `root_binding_of_canonical`: between canonical lists of equal enclosing
    width, the root identifies the list — or a concrete collision. This is
    the property the canonicality rule exists to restore.
