  # Collisions and collision resistance of a function

  The collision vocabulary, stated over an arbitrary function rather than any
  particular hash. A collision is two distinct inputs with the same image;
  collision resistance is the absence of one. Both are interesting independent
  of which function appears — `sha256d`, a merkle node combiner, an abstract
  commitment hash — so they live here once and specialize where needed.

  Collision resistance is never an axiom over a concrete function (it is
  provably false there by pigeonhole). It enters as a *hypothesis*, and from it
  injectivity follows: a collision-resistant function is injective on the nose.
  Composition is the other load-bearing fact — a collision in `g ∘ f` is a
  collision in `f` or in `g` — which is exactly what carries collision
  resistance through Bitcoin's double hashing.

  Checked claims:

  * `CollisionResistant.injective`: a collision-resistant function is injective.
  * `Collision.comp`: a collision in `g ∘ f` yields a collision in `f` or `g`.
  * `CollisionResistant.comp`: collision resistance of `f` and `g` gives
    collision resistance of `g ∘ f`.

/-- The partial dual of `CollisionResistant.comp`: resistance of `g ∘ f` forces
resistance of the *inner* `f` (a collision in `f` would lift to one in the
composite). It does **not** force resistance of the outer `g` — `g` may collide
on values outside the range of `f`, where no composite input reaches. -/
