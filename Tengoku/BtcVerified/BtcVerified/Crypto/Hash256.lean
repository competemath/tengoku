  # The 256-bit hash type

  Txids, block hashes, and merkle nodes are all 256-bit digests; this fixes the
  one type they share — as the 32 raw digest bytes, in the order SHA-256 emits
  them, which is also the order they take on the wire. A digest is an identifier
  you concatenate and compare for equality, never a number you do arithmetic on,
  so the natural representation is bytes, not `BitVec 256`. The numeric reading
  (and the only place endianness matters) is deferred to where a digest meets a
  *target* in the proof-of-work check.

  The familiar big-endian display hex is these bytes reversed; that reversal is
  a display convention only, with no role in hashing or the wire codec — so it
  lives in test helpers, not here. On the wire a hash is exactly its 32 bytes,
  so its codec writes them as-is, with no little-endian step.

  Checked claims:

  * `instCodecHash256`: the hash codec inherited from `Bytes 32`
    round-trips and is canonical — 32 raw bytes off the front.
