  # Block header hashes

  The block hash: the double-SHA-256 of a header's 80-byte encoding, the same
  digest proof-of-work targets and `prevBlockHash` links commit to. Promoted
  from the ad hoc `Sha256.sha256d (Codec.encode b.header)` expression the
  fixture tests computed inline into the library — the same move `Tx.txid`
  made for transactions.

  As with `Tx.txid_binding`, the binding theorem here is the
  collision-disjunct idiom (`Merkle.root_binding_of_length_eq` is the same
  shape):
  the hash is a binding commitment to the header — equal hashes force equal
  headers, or the two encodings exhibit a concrete double-SHA-256 collision.
  Collision resistance is never assumed for the concrete hash — only ever a
  hypothesis a caller supplies over the abstract `Sha256.Collision`
  vocabulary.

  Checked claims:

  * `BlockHeader.hash_binding`: equal block hashes mean equal headers — or a
    concrete double-SHA-256 collision.
