  # The block header

  The 80 bytes proof of work covers: version, previous-header hash, merkle
  root, time, the compact target encoding, and the nonce. The two hash fields
  are where chain structure and the transaction commitment enter the model —
  `prevBlockHash` is what makes blocks a tree, `merkleRoot` is what ties a
  header to its transactions. Interpreting `bits` as a 256-bit target and
  checking the header hash against it belongs to the proof-of-work layer, not
  this module.

  The wire format and the model agree on field order, so the codec comes by
  composition over the fields (`Codec.ofEquiv`), with no hand-written proofs.

  Checked claims:

  * `instCodecBlockHeader`: the header codec satisfies round-trip and
    canonicality, inherited field by field.
  * `BlockHeader.encode_length`: every header encodes to exactly 80 bytes —
    the fixed proof-of-work preimage size.
